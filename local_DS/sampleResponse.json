worldwide, in\r\n            the link between education systems and the production of\r\n            skills that are valued in the labor market. With growth\r\n            stagnating and unemployment soaring in much of the world,\r\n            educators are being asked to focus more on producing skills\r\n            that feed into labor productivity and support the\r\n            sustainable growth of employment and incomes. This timely\r\n            volume contributes important new findings on the dynamics of\r\n            education systems and labor market outcomes in Latin America\r\n            and the Caribbean (LAC). It analyzes an important recent\r\n            shift in labor market trends in LAC: the first decade of the\r\n            21st century has witnessed a marked decline in the earnings\r\n            premia for university and secondary education. This, in\r\n            turn, is contributing to reduced income inequality across\r\n            the region. The recent trend contrasts with the sharp rise\r\n            in tertiary earnings premia that was observed in the 1990s\r\n            and that helped to reinforce high levels of income\r\n            inequality in the region at that time. The authors recommend\r\n            that, having achieved very large increases in secondary and\r\n            tertiary enrollment, the region should now focus on\r\n            improving the quality of its education systems and the\r\n            pertinence of education curricula for the needs of the labor\r\n            market. At age 15, the learning achievement of the average\r\n            Latin American student still lags two years behind his or\r\n            her Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development\r\n            (OECD) contemporary. The study opens up an important agenda\r\n            for future research.

With growth\r\n            stagnating and unemployment soaring in much of the world,\r\n            educators are being asked to focus more on producing skills\r\n            that feed into labor productivity and support the\r\n            sustainable growth of employment and incomes. This timely\r\n            volume contributes important new findings on the dynamics of\r\n            education systems and labor market outcomes in Latin America\r\n            and the Caribbean (LAC). It analyzes an important recent\r\n            shift in labor market trends in LAC: the first decade of the\r\n            21st century has witnessed a marked decline in the earnings\r\n            premia for university and secondary education. This, in\r\n            turn, is contributing to reduced income inequality across\r\n            the region. The recent trend contrasts with the sharp rise\r\n            in tertiary earnings premia that was observed in the 1990s\r\n            and that helped to reinforce high levels of income\r\n            inequality in the region at that time. The authors recommend\r\n            that, having achieved very large increases in secondary and\r\n            tertiary enrollment, the region should now focus on\r\n            improving the quality of its education systems and the\r\n            pertinence of education curricula for the needs of the labor\r\n            market. At age 15, the learning achievement of the average\r\n            Latin American student still lags two years behind his or\r\n            her Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development\r\n            (OECD) contemporary. The study opens up an important agenda\r\n            for future research.

Section one\r\n            provides a brief background of the infrastructure needs in\r\n            the sample countries and outlines the current scope of\r\n            Public-Private Partnership (PPP) transactions; section two\r\n            examines the sources of financing for PPPs domestic and\r\n            foreign with a particular focus on domestic sources; section\r\n            three explores the supporting legislative, regulatory, and\r\n            institutional environment for PPPs; section four addresses\r\n            issues connected with the importance of developing a sound\r\n            pipeline of PPP projects; and section five tackles the\r\n            importance of managing the increased government fiscal\r\n            commitments that are commonly coupled with PPPs. Section six\r\n            outlines medium-term options for PPP financing. Finally,\r\n            section seven puts forth policy recommendations intended to\r\n            assist in overcoming the challenges in building private\r\n            sector confidence in the Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)\r\n            infrastructure market in order to attract greater levels of\r\n            financing for private sector investment in core\r\n            infrastructure

Demand for\r\n            electricity increased steadily with gross domestic product\r\n            (GDP).

By early 2009, it\r\n            was clear that this economic downturn would be more severe\r\n            than any crisis since the great depression, prompting some\r\n            to it as the 'great recession.'

Part three covers the structural and\r\n            sectoral policies that affect longer-term economic growth\r\n            and poverty reduction. To underscore the impact of good\r\n            governance and effective service delivery in growth and\r\n            poverty reduction, separate chapters are devoted to\r\n            institutional and technological development, education,\r\n            health, labor, and land. The volume ends with a chapter that\r\n            summarizes knowledge of growth theory, reviews the process\r\n            of growth in 13 successful countries, and draws out\r\n            implications for other developing countries. The authors\r\n            hope that this chapter may be of help to policy makers in\r\n            identifying the constraints to economic growth and\r\n            development that may be unique to each country."], "identifiers": ["978-0-8213-6953-1", "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2281", "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2281/600570PUB0REPL10Box358306B01PUBLIC1.pdf?sequence=1", "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2281/600570PUB0REPL10Box358306B01PUBLIC1.txt?sequence=2", "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2281/license.txt?sequence=3", "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2281/600570PUB0REPL10Box358306B01PUBLIC1.pdf.jpg?sequence=4"], "uri": ["http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2281"], "subjectTags": ["ACCESS TO LOANS", "ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANCE", "ADULT MORTALITY", "ADULT POPULATION", "AGED", "AGGREGATE POVERTY", "AGRICULTURAL PRODUCE", "AIDS EPIDEMIC", "AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD INCOME", "BANK OFFICE", "BASIC NEEDS", "BENEFITS OF MIGRATION", "BUSINESS OWNERSHIP", "CAPITAL INVESTMENT", "CARIBBEAN REGION", "CASH EXPENDITURES", "CHRONIC ILLNESS", "CITIZENS", "CONSUMPTION AGGREGATE", "CONSUMPTION EXPENDITURE", "CONSUMPTION PER CAPITA", "CONSUMPTION SMOOTHING", "COPING STRATEGY", "COUNTERFACTUAL", "COUNTRY OF DESTINATION", "CULTURAL BARRIERS", "DECLINE IN POVERTY", "DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS", "DEMOGRAPHIC COMPOSITION", "DEVELOPING COUNTRIES", "DEVELOPMENT BANK", "DISSEMINATION", "DIVORCE", "DOMESTIC LABOR", "DROUGHT", "EARNINGS", "ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT", "ECONOMIC GROWTH", "ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES", "ECONOMIC SHOCKS", "EDUCATION LEVEL", "EDUCATION LEVELS", "EMPLOYER", "EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES", "EXCLUSION", "EXPATRIATES", "EXPLOITATION", "EXPORT MARKETS", "FAMILIES", "FAMILY MEMBERS", "FERTILITY", "FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS", "FINANCIAL COST", "FOOD CONSUMPTION", "FOOD CONSUMPTION PER CAPITA", "FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT", "FULL POTENTIAL OF MIGRATION", "GENDER", "GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT", "GOVERNMENT POLICIES", "GOVERNMENT POLICY", "GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT", "HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD", "HIV", "HOUSEHOLD ASSETS", "HOUSEHOLD BUDGET", "HOUSEHOLD CONSUMPTION", "HOUSEHOLD EXPENDITURES ON FOOD", "HOUSEHOLD HEAD", "HOUSEHOLD HEAD AGE", "HOUSEHOLD INCOME", "HOUSEHOLD LEVEL", "HOUSEHOLD NUMBER", "HOUSEHOLD SIZE", "HOUSEHOLD SURVEY", "HOUSEHOLD WELFARE", "HOUSING", "HUMAN CAPITAL", "HUSBAND", "HUSBANDS", "ILLNESS", "IMMIGRATION", "IMMIGRATION POLICIES", "IMPACT OF MIGRATION", "IMPERFECT INFORMATION", "INCOME DISTRIBUTION", "INCOME DYNAMICS", "INCOME GAINS", "INCOME GROUPS", "INCOME GROWTH", "INCOME INEQUALITY", "INHERITANCE", "INSURANCE", "INTEREST RATES", "INTERNATIONAL BANK", "INTERNATIONAL MIGRANT", "INTERNATIONAL MIGRANTS", "INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION", "INTERVENTION", "ISOLATION", "JOB OPPORTUNITIES", "KINSHIP", "KINSHIP NETWORKS", "LABOR MARKET", "LABOR MARKET ACTIVITIES", "LABOR MARKETS", "LABOR MOBILITY", "LACK OF CREDIT", "LACK OF FINANCE", "LACK OF INFORMATION", "LAND HOLDINGS", "LAND VALUE", "LEGAL STATUS", "LIMITED ACCESS", "LIVING STANDARDS", "LOAN", "LOW-INCOME COUNTRIES", "MALARIA", "MARKET FAILURES", "MARKETING", "MEDICAL TREATMENT", "MIGRANT", "MIGRANT WORKERS", "MIGRANTS", "MIGRATION", "MIGRATION PROCESS", "MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS", "MINISTRY OF HEALTH", "MONEYLENDERS", "MOTHER", "MOUNTAIN REGION", "NATIONAL BORDERS", "NATURAL DISASTERS", "PER CAPITA CONSUMPTION", "PERMANENT MIGRATION STATUS", "PHYSICAL CAPITAL", "POLICY IMPLICATIONS", "POLICY MAKERS", "POLICY RESEARCH", "POLICY RESEARCH WORKING PAPER", "POLITICAL ECONOMY", "POLITICAL INSTABILITY", "POOR", "POOR HOUSEHOLDS", "POOR INDIVIDUALS", "POOR PEOPLE", "POOR RURAL REGIONS", "POORER HOUSEHOLDS", "POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT", "POPULATION GROWTH", "POVERTY DATA", "POVERTY DYNAMICS", "POVERTY IMPACT", "POVERTY INDICATORS", "POVERTY LEVELS", "POVERTY LINE", "POVERTY LINKAGES", "POVERTY RATE", "POVERTY RATES", "POVERTY REDUCTION", "PRACTITIONERS", "PRODUCTION PROCESS", "PROGRESS", "PUBLIC POLICY", "PULL FACTORS", "PURCHASING POWER", "PURCHASING POWER PARITY", "PUSH FACTORS", "QUALITATIVE DATA", "REDUCTION IN POVERTY", "REGIONAL CAPITAL", "REGIONAL LABOR", "REGIONAL LABOR MARKETS", "REGIONAL OFFICE", "REMITTANCE", "REMITTANCES", "REMOTE AREAS", "REMOTE LOCATIONS", "RESOURCE ALLOCATION", "RESPECT", "RETURN MIGRATION", "RISK SHARING", "RURAL", "RURAL AREA", "RURAL AREAS", "RURAL MIGRATION", "RURAL REGIONS", "RURAL VILLAGES", "SAVINGS", "SCHOOLING", "SEX", "SIBLINGS", "SOCIAL NETWORKS", "SOCIAL NORMS", "SOCIAL POLICY", "SOCIAL PROTECTION", "SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS", "SOURCE OF INCOME", "SOURCE OF OPPORTUNITIES", "SPILLOVER", "SPOUSE", "TEENS", "TEMPORARY MIGRANTS", "TEMPORARY MIGRATION", "TRADITIONAL VALUES", "UNDOCUMENTED MIGRATION", "UNEMPLOYMENT", "URBAN AREAS", "URBAN CENTER", "URBAN MIGRATION", "URBANIZATION", "USE PER CAPITA", "VILLAGE", "VIOLENCE", "YOUNG ADULTS"], "setSpecs": ["com_10986_2122", "com_10986_4", "col_10986_2146"], "relation": ["Directions in Development ;

Chapter one is an\r\n            introduction to ADePT Edu. It describes its origin and\r\n            intended use and familiarizes readers with educational\r\n            statistics. Chapter two is intended for users unfamiliar\r\n            with the different datasets that contain education\r\n            statistics and household-level data that contain information\r\n            on education.

These thefts diverts valuable public\r\n            resources from addressing the abject poverty and fragile\r\n            infrastructure often present in such countries. Although the\r\n            exact magnitude of the proceeds of corruption circulating in\r\n            the global economy is impossible to ascertain, estimates\r\n            demonstrate the severity and scale of the problem at $20 to\r\n            $40 billion lost to developing countries each year. What\r\n            this estimate does not capture are the societal costs of\r\n            corruption and the devastating impact of such crimes on\r\n            victim countries.

This book brings\r\n            relevant experience from both developed and developing\r\n            countries to bear on issues confronting today's\r\n            governments in linking with their diaspora. The chapters\r\n            present different approaches used by countries that have\r\n            tried to maximize the possible gains from migration by\r\n            engaging more comprehensively with different diaspora groups\r\n            and individuals. Some African countries are pursuing\r\n            policies to develop links with Africans abroad, either to\r\n            encourage them to return or to use their skills, knowledge,\r\n            or financial capital to foster African development. The book\r\n            discusses concrete examples of diaspora initiatives that are\r\n            being implemented in Africa.

This book brings\r\n            relevant experience from both developed and developing\r\n            countries to bear on issues confronting today's\r\n            governments in linking with their diaspora. The chapters\r\n            present different approaches used by countries that have\r\n            tried to maximize the possible gains from migration by\r\n            engaging more comprehensively with different diaspora groups\r\n            and individuals. Some African countries are pursuing\r\n            policies to develop links with Africans abroad, either to\r\n            encourage them to return or to use their skills, knowledge,\r\n            or financial capital to foster African development.

It\r\n            attracted widespread media coverage feeding directly into\r\n            discussions at the 2009 African Union Commission Heads of\r\n            State Summit on Infrastructure. Although the flagship report\r\n            served a valuable role in highlighting the main findings of\r\n            the project, it could not do full justice to the richness of\r\n            the data collected and technical analysis undertaken. There\r\n            was clearly a need to make this more detailed material\r\n            available to a wider audience of infrastructure\r\n            practitioners. Hence the idea of producing four technical\r\n            monographs, such as this one, to provide detailed results on\r\n            each of the major infrastructure sectors, information and\r\n            communication technologies (ICT), power, transport, and\r\n            water, as companions to the flagship report. These technical\r\n            volumes are intended as reference books on each of the\r\n            infrastructure sectors. They cover all aspects of the AICD\r\n            project relevant to each sector, including sector\r\n            performance, gaps in financing and efficiency, and estimates\r\n            of the need for additional spending on investment,\r\n            operations, and maintenance. Each volume also comes with a\r\n            detailed data appendix, providing easy access to all the\r\n            relevant infrastructure indicators at the country level,\r\n            which is a resource in and of itself."], "identifiers": ["978-0-8213-8457-2", "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2276", "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2276/608040PUB0Afri10Box358332B01PUBLIC1.pdf?sequence=1", "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2276/608040PUB0Afri10Box358332B01PUBLIC1.txt?sequence=2", "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2276/license.txt?sequence=3", "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2276/608040PUB0Afri10Box358332B01PUBLIC1.pdf.jpg?sequence=4"], "uri": ["http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2276"], "subjectTags": ["ACCESS TO SAFE DRINKING WATER", "ACCESS TO SAFE WATER", "ACCESS TO SANITATION", "ACCESS TO WATER", "ACCESS TO WATER SUPPLY", "ADEQUATE SANITATION", "ADMINISTRATIVE CAPACITY", "AFFORDABILITY OF WATER", "AVAILABILITY OF WATER", "BLOCK TARIFF", "BLOCK TARIFF STRUCTURE", "BLOCK TARIFFS", "BOREHOLES", "BROAD RANGE", "BULK WATER", "CENTRAL GOVERNMENT", "CONCESSION CONTRACT", "CONNECTION COST", "CONSTRUCTION", "COST RECOVERY", "COVERING", "CUBIC METER", "CUBIC METERS", "DEMAND MANAGEMENT", "DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS", "DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM", "DOMESTIC TARIFFS", "DRINKING WATER", "DRINKING WATER COVERAGE", "FLUSH TOILET", "FLUSH TOILETS", "GLOBAL WATER SUPPLY", "HAND PUMPS", "HOUSE CONNECTION", "HOUSEHOLD CONNECTION", "HOUSEHOLD CONNECTIONS", "HOUSEHOLDS", "IRRIGATION", "LARGE CITIES", "LOW WATER", "METERING", "MINERALS", "NATIONAL WATER", "NATIONAL WATER COMPANY", "NATURAL RESOURCES", "NONREVENUE WATER", "OPEN DEFECATION", "OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY", "OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE", "OPERATORS", "PERFORMANCE CONTRACT", "PERFORMANCE CONTRACTS", "PERFORMANCE DATA", "PERFORMANCE INDICATORS", "PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE", "PIPED WATER", "PIT LATRINE", "PIT LATRINES", "PITS", "POPULATION DENSITY", "POPULATION GROWTH", "PRESSURE", "PRIVATE PARTICIPATION", "PROVISION OF WATER", "PUBLIC HEALTH", "PUBLIC STANDPOSTS", "PUBLIC TAP", "QUALITY OF SERVICE", "QUALITY OF WATER", "QUALITY OF WATER SUPPLY", "RAINWATER", "REGULATORY AGENCIES", "REGULATORY AGENCY", "REGULATORY FRAMEWORK", "REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS", "RESIDENTIAL CONSUMERS", "RURAL WATER", "RURAL WATER SUPPLY", "SAFE SANITATION", "SANITATION ACCESS", "SANITATION ASSESSMENT", "SANITATION AUTHORITY", "SANITATION COVERAGE", "SANITATION FACILITIES", "SANITATION INFRASTRUCTURE", "SANITATION MARKET", "SANITATION OPTIONS", "SANITATION PROGRAM", "SANITATION SECTOR", "SANITATION SERVICES", "SANITATION TARIFFS", "SANITATION TAX", "SANITATION UTILITIES", "SANITATION WATER", "SEPTIC TANK", "SEPTIC TANKS", "SERVICE CONTINUITY", "SERVICE DELIVERY", "SERVICE PROVIDER", "SERVICE PROVIDERS", "SERVICE PROVISION", "SERVICE QUALITY", "SEWAGE DISPOSAL", "SEWERAGE", "SEWERAGE AUTHORITY", "SEWERAGE COMPANY", "SEWERAGE NETWORK", "SEWERAGE SYSTEMS", "SOURCES OF WATER", "STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT", "SUPPLY WATER", "SURFACE SOURCES", "SURFACE WATER", "TARIFF ADJUSTMENT", "TARIFF STRUCTURE", "TOILET FACILITIES", "URBAN AREAS", "URBAN HOUSEHOLDS", "URBAN RESIDENTS", "URBAN UTILITIES", "URBAN WATER", "URBAN WATER SECTOR", "URBAN WATER SUPPLY", "URBAN WATER UTILITIES", "URBANIZATION", "USER CHARGES", "USERS", "UTILITIES CORPORATION", "UTILITY EFFICIENCY", "VIP LATRINES", "WASTEWATER", "WASTEWATER MANAGEMENT", "WATER AVAILABILITY", "WATER BILLS", "WATER BOARD", "WATER COMPANY", "WATER CONNECTION", "WATER CONNECTIONS", "WATER CONSUMPTION", "WATER COVERAGE", "WATER DISTRIBUTION", "WATER INFRASTRUCTURE", "WATER LOSSES", "WATER MARKET", "WATER MARKETS", "WATER POINTS", "WATER PRODUCTION", "WATER QUALITY", "WATER SANITATION", "WATER SCARCITY", "WATER SECTOR", "WATER SERVICE", "WATER SERVICE PROVISION", "WATER SERVICES", "WATER SOURCE", "WATER SOURCES", "WATER STANDPOSTS", "WATER SUPPLY", "WATER TABLE", "WATER TANKERS", "WATER TARIFFS", "WATER UTILITIES", "WATER VENDORS", "WELLS"], "setSpecs": ["com_10986_2122", "com_10986_4", "col_10986_2146"], "relation": ["Directions in Development ; infrastructure"], "title": ["Africa's Water and Sanitation\r\n            Infrastructure : Access, Affordability, and Alternatives"], "creators": ["Banerjee, Sudeshna Ghosh", "Morella, Elvira"], "okr_id": ["oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2276"]}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2271": {"publisher": ["World Bank"], "dates": ["2012-03-19T09:02:55Z", "2012-03-19T09:02:55Z", "2011-01-28"], "description": ["This report presents an overview of how\r\n            the energy sector might be impacted by climate change and\r\n            what options exist for its management.

The\r\n            book stresses that, while the recent turnaround in\r\n            Africa's economic growth is encouraging, this growth\r\n            must be accompanied by structural transformation to be\r\n            sustainable and to create productive employment for its\r\n            people. For many African countries, this transformation\r\n            involves lifting workers from low-productivity agriculture\r\n            and informal sectors into higher productivity activities.\r\n            Light manufacturing can offer a viable solution for\r\n            Sub-Saharan Africa, given its potential competitiveness that\r\n            is based on low wage costs and abundance of natural\r\n            resources that supply raw materials needed for industries.\r\n            This study has five features that distinguish it from\r\n            previous studies. First, the detailed studies on light\r\n            manufacturing at the subsector and product levels in five\r\n            countries provide in-depth cost comparisons between Asia and\r\n            Africa.

The authors look\r\n            forward to the benefits that the knowledge gained and the\r\n            partnerships forged during the symposium will have for\r\n            global efforts on cities and climate change."], "identifiers": ["978-0-8213-8493-0", "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2312", "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2312/626960PUB0Citi000public00BOX361489B.pdf?sequence=1", "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2312/626960PUB0Citi000public00BOX361489B.txt?sequence=2", "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2312/license.txt?sequence=3", "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2312/626960PUB0Citi000public00BOX361489B.pdf.jpg?sequence=4"], "uri": ["http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2312"], "subjectTags": [""], "setSpecs": ["com_10986_2122", "com_10986_4", "col_10986_2174"], "relation": ["Urban Development Series"], "title": ["Cities and Climate Change :\r\n            Responding to an Urgent Agenda"], "creators": ["Hoornweg, Daniel", "Freire, Mila", "Lee, Marcus J.", "Bhada-Tata, Perinaz", "Yuen, Belinda"], "okr_id": ["oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2312"]}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2313": {"publisher": ["World Bank"], "dates": ["2012-03-19T09:03:54Z", "2012-03-19T09:03:54Z", "2011-06-13"], "description": ["The world economy is in the midst of a\r\n            transformative change.
