Improvements in child health and malaria in particular can be attributed to strong government commitment towards health results, reflected in a number of notable policies and programs related to Human Resources for Health (HRH), in particular the health extension worker program. However, indicators related to maternal health remain problematic. Ethiopia has one of the lowest levels of assisted deliveries in the region. Although increases in the number of health workers particularly in rural areas may have contributed to improving access to some health services, it is in the government's interest to further improve the stock, distribution, and performance of relevant health workers in Ethiopia, particularly to bring about improvement in access to maternal health services for the poor. This document reviews the current HRH situation in Ethiopia, summarizes the evidence on population use of select health services, and offers relevant policy options to assist the government finalize its new human resources strategy and address remaining health challenges.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2226", "subjectTags": ["abortion", "abortion care", "access to care", "access to education", "access to health care", "access to health services", "aged", "antenatal care", "babies", "basic health", "basic health services", "bulletin", "certification", "child health", "cities", "clinics", "community health", "country of destination", "death rate", "deaths", "decision making", "developing countries", "dissemination", "doctors", "drugs", "emergency obstetric care", "employment", "environmental health", "equality of opportunity", "equitable access", "eye care", "families", "family planning", "female", "females", "gender", "general practitioner", "general practitioners", "gross domestic product", "health care", "health care facilities", "health care provider", "health care services", "health centers", "health centre", "health expenditure", "health expenditures", "health extension", "health facilities", "health indicators", "health management", "health messages", "health organization", "health outcomes", "health posts", "health professional", "health professionals", "health providers", "health results", "health sector", "health service", "health services", "health systems", "health systems strengthening", "health training", "health workforce", "health-seeking behavior", "hiv", "hiv/aids", "home visits", "hospital", "hospitals", "household income", "hr", "human immunodeficiency virus", "human resource management", "human resources", "immigration", "immunization", "immunodeficiency", "income", "infant", "infant health", "infant health care", "information system", "intervention", "iron", "job security", "labor force", "labor market", "labor markets", "laboratory workers", "large population", "legal status", "live births", "living conditions", "local community", "malaria", "malaria cases", "maternal and child health", "maternal care", "maternal health", "maternal health services", "maternal mortality", "maternal mortality ratio", "maternal mortality ratios", "maternity care", "maternity leave", "medical care", "medical doctor", "medical doctors", "medical education", "medical school", "medical schools", "medicine", "midwife", "midwifery", "midwives", "migrants", "migration", "millennium development goals", "ministry of education", "ministry of health", "minority", "morbidity", "mortality", "mortality rate", "mother", "mothers", "neonatal health", "neonatal mortality", "newborn", "newborn care", "nurse", "nurses", "nursing", "obstetrics", "paramedics", "patient", "patient satisfaction", "patients", "pharmacist", "pharmacists", "pharmacy", "physician", "physicians", "policy discussions", "policy implications", "policy-making process", "population data", "postnatal care", "potential migrants", "potential users", "pregnancy", "pregnant mothers", "premature death", "prevalence", "probability", "progress", "public health", "public health provision", "public health workers", "push factors", "quality assurance", "rural areas", "rural communities", "rural residents", "sanitation", "school curricula", "school health", "school students", "secondary education", "secondary school", "secondary school education", "sex", "sexual violence", "short supply", "sick leave", "socioeconomic differences", "specialist", "specialists", "surgery", "teaching hospitals", "technical assistance", "tetanus", "training opportunities", "treatment", "urban areas", "urban bias", "urban populations", "victims", "workers", "working conditions", "workplace", "world health organization", "young women"], "pubtype": ["World Bank Study"], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2226/662180PUB0EPI00pia0health0workforse.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2226/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2226", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T08:43:52Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2228": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2228/9780821389720.pdf.jpg?sequence=5", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2228/662350PUB0EPI000India09780821389720.txt?sequence=2", "title": "The Remittance Market in India : Opportunities, Challenges, and Policy Options", "abstract": "In chapter one, this report maps the patterns and characteristics of migration flows from India; in chapter two, it provides a detailed discussion of remittance flows to India in terms of their importance, sources, uses, trends, costs, and links to financial access.

The diagnostic covers the legal and regulatory framework, payment system infrastructure, market transparency and level of consumer protection, market structure, level of competition among remittance service providers, as well as market governance. It analyzes the existing situation in India and provides detailed recommendations (including lessons learned from international best practices) that are aimed at increasing competition in the remittance industry, providing broader access to payment system infrastructure, enhancing transparency, and ensuring a sound and predictable legal and regulatory framework. Several of the actions could set a basis for leveraging remittances to achieve other important public policy goals such as broadening financial access, expanding financial inclusion, and both strengthening and deepening the financial sector.

Macroeconomic data and forecasts are easily available when crises strike. But policy action requires not only understanding the magnitude of a macro shock, but also identifying which households or individuals are being hurt by (or benefit from) the crisis. Moreover, in many cases, impacts on the ground might be already occurring as macro developments become known, while micro level evidence is still unavailable because of paucity of data. Because of these reasons, a comprehensive real-time understanding of how the aggregate changes will translate to impacts at the micro level remains elusive. This problem is particularly acute when dealing with developing countries where household data is sporadic or out of date. This volume outlines a more comprehensive approach to the problem, showcasing a micro simulation model, developed in response to demand from World Bank staff working in countries and country governments in the wake of the global financial crisis of 2008-09. During the growing catastrophe in a few industrialized countries, there was rising concern about how the crisis would affect the developing world and how to respond to it through public policies. World Bank staff s was scrambling to help countries design such policies; this in turn required information on which groups of the population, sectors and regions the crisis would likely affect and to what extent. The volume is organized as follows. Chapter 1 summarizes the methodology underlying the micro simulation model to predict distributional impacts of the crisis, along with several case studies that highlight how the model can be used in different country contexts. Chapters 2 to 4 are written by experts external to the Bank, two of whom participated as discussants at a workshop on the micro simulation work organized in May, 2010 at the World Bank headquarters. Chapter 2 comments on the broader implications and shortcomings of applying the technique described in Chapter 1 and the ability or willingness of governments to respond adequately to its results. Chapter 3 draws parallels between the United States and developing countries to discuss the lessons that can be learned for mitigating the impacts of future crises. Chapter 4 discusses how the micro simulation approach can be sharpened to make it a better tool for distributional analysis moving forward.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2229", "subjectTags": ["accounting", "aggregate employment", "aggregate inequality", "aggregate output", "anti-poverty", "anti-poverty programs", "average income", "beneficiaries", "calorie intake", "constant poverty line", "counterfactual", "crises", "data requirements", "demographic changes", "developed countries", "developed world", "developing countries", "developing world", "development institutions", "distributional effects", "distributional impact", "economic conditions", "economic growth", "elasticity", "empirical evidence", "empirical work", "employment impacts", "employment status", "extreme poverty", "extreme poverty lines", "farmers", "female employment", "female participation", "financial crisis", "financial markets", "food basket", "food price", "food prices", "food requirements", "general equilibrium", "general equilibrium models", "global markets", "growth rates", "historical data", "household data", "household heads", "household income", "household incomes", "household members", "household survey", "impact on poverty", "income", "income distribution", "income distributions", "income gains", "income groups", "income growth", "income level", "income levels", "income scale", "income shock", "income shocks", "income source", "income sources", "incomes", "individual countries", "inequality", "inequality measures", "innovations", "insurance", "labor force", "labor force participation", "labor market", "labor markets", "macroeconomic mismanagement", "macroeconomic shocks", "middle class", "national poverty", "new poor", "nominal wages", "nutrition", "occupations", "outputs", "participation rates", "per capita income", "policy changes", "policy decisions", "policy design", "policy interventions", "policy measures", "political economy", "poor", "poor households", "poor rural households", "population growth", "poverty estimates", "poverty gap", "poverty headcount", "poverty headcount rate", "poverty impact", "poverty impacts", "poverty increase", "poverty indices", "poverty line", "poverty lines", "poverty programs", "poverty rate", "poverty rates", "poverty reduction", "price changes", "private transfers", "productivity", "public policies", "public transfers", "real output", "relative importance", "relative prices", "rents", "rural", "rural areas", "rural household", "rural income", "safety", "safety net", "safety net programs", "safety nets", "significant differences", "social assistance", "social benefits", "social policy", "social programs", "sustainable development", "targeting", "transfer programs", "unemployed", "unemployment", "unemployment benefits", "unemployment rate", "wages", "young workers"], "pubtype": ["World Bank Study"], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2229/662370PUB0EPI00t0know09780821389812.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2229/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2229", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T08:44:04Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2308": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2308/622610PUB0glob01476B0extop0ID018726.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2308/622610PUB0glob01476B0extop0ID018726.txt?sequence=2", "title": "The Global HIV Epidemics among Men Who Have Sex with Men", "abstract": "Men who have sex with Men (MSM) are currently at marked risk for HIV infection in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) in Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, and in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Estimates of HIV prevalence rates have been consistently higher among MSM than for the general population of reproductive-age men virtually wherever MSM have been well studied. Although scarce, HIV incidence data support findings of high acquisition and transmission risks among MSM in multiple contexts, cultural settings, and economic levels. Research among MSM in LMICs has been limited by the criminalization and social stigmatization of these behaviors, the safety considerations for study participants, the hidden nature of these populations, and a lack of targeted funding. Available evidence from these countries suggests that structural risks social, economic, political, or legal factors in addition to individual-level risk factors are likely to play important roles in shaping HIV risks and treatment and care options for these men. Services and resources for populations of MSM remain markedly low in many settings. They have limited coverage and access to HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care services with some estimates suggesting that fewer than one in ten MSM worldwide have access to the most basic package of preventive interventions.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2308", "subjectTags": ["access to condoms", "access to treatment", "acquired immune deficiency syndrome", "adult population", "age distribution", "aids relief", "aids research", "behavioral interventions", "biological measures", "bisexual", "bisexuals", "both sexes", "circumcision", "cocaine", "community health", "community outreach", "community participation", "condom", "condom use", "condom use among men", "counseling intervention", "disability", "discrimination", "disease", "disease burden", "disease control", "dissemination", "distribution of condoms", "drug user", "drugs", "effective use", "emergency plan", "epidemic", "epidemic scenarios", "epidemics", "epidemiologic data", "epidemiology", "exercises", "female condoms", "female sex partners", "female sex workers", "gay men", "gender equality", "gross domestic product", "gross national income", "harm reduction", "hazard", "health care", "health care providers", "health interventions", "health promotion", "health sector", "health systems", "hepatitis", "hepatitis a", "hepatitis b", "hepatitis b virus", "herpes", "herpes simplex", "herpes simplex virus", "heterosexuals", "hiv", "hiv epidemics", "hiv infection", "hiv infections", "hiv prevalence", "hiv prevalence rates", "hiv prevention", "hiv prevention interventions", "hiv testing", "hiv transmission", "hiv/aids", "homosexuality", "homosexuals", "hospital", "human development", "human dignity", "human immunodeficiency virus", "human rights", "immune deficiency", "immune deficiency syndromes", "immunodeficiency", "impact of hiv", "infectious diseases", "injecting drug use", "injecting drug users", "injection drug", "injection drug use", "intercourse", "international community", "journal of epidemiology", "journal of medicine", "legal protection", "legal status", "lesbians", "malaria", "male sex", "mass media", "medical research", "medicine", "mental health", "methadone", "microbicides", "ministry of health", "national aids", "national aids control", "national laws", "needle exchange", "new infections", "opportunistic infections", "outreach workers", "partner reduction", "peer outreach", "percent hiv prevalence", "policy makers", "population council", "prevalence", "prevalence rates", "prevention and care", "prevention components", "primary health care", "prophylaxis", "public health", "purchasing power", "receptive anal intercourse", "reproductive age", "reproductive health", "respect", "risk factors", "risk groups", "risk populations", "risk reduction", "risk-reduction", "risk-reduction interventions", "screening", "self-esteem", "service provision", "set of recommendations", "sex", "sex behavior", "sex practices", "sex with men", "sex worker", "sex workers", "sexual behavior", "sexual behaviors", "sexual minorities", "sexual orientation", "sexual partner", "sexual partners", "sexual practices", "sexually transmitted infection", "sexually transmitted infections", "social justice", "stis", "substance use", "syndromes", "therapy", "tolerance", "treatment", "treatment and care", "tuberculosis", "unaids", "universal access", "unprotected anal intercourse", "urban areas", "use of condoms", "use of resources", "vaccination", "vaccine", "virus", "voluntary counseling", "woman", "world health organization"], "pubtype": ["Directions in Development"], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2308/622610PUB0glob01476B0extop0ID018726.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2308/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2308", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:03:48Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2305": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2305/618960PUB0Harn000public00BOX358355B.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2305/618960PUB0Harn000public00BOX358355B.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Harnessing Quality for Global Competitiveness in Eastern Europe and Central Asia", "abstract": "In many countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia (ECA), the National Quality Infrastructure (NQI) does not support business competitiveness, though this is one of its functions in organization for economic co-operation and development countries. In most of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries, it even impedes competitiveness. The most common economic benefits of adopting standards include increased productive and innovative efficiency. Standards lead to economies of scale, allowing suppliers to achieve lower costs per unit by producing large, homogeneous batches of products. Standards spur and disseminate innovation, solve coordination failures, and facilitate the development of profitable networks. Participation in world trade increasingly requires that suppliers comply with standards determined by lead buyers in global value chains. The nature of participation in the global economy has changed dramatically over the past two decades. Rarely do producers turn raw materials into final products and sell them directly to customers. Improving the quality of goods and services and diversifying into sectors where quality matters can be a sustainable source of global competitiveness. Some of the productive tasks associated with high-quality goods have high learning and technological externalities. In those sectors, producers tend to form tight relationships with global buyers who transfer their knowledge and support the producers' quality-upgrading processes. Diversifying into a broad range of sectors also reduces macroeconomic volatility, but quality upgrading becomes necessary to enter new sectors that compete on quality.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2305", "subjectTags": ["capabilities", "classrooms", "communities", "communities of practice", "content providers", "distance learning", "documents", "knowledge sharing", "knowledge transfer", "leadership", "learning", "learning activities", "learning centers", "learning experiences", "management system", "marketing", "material", "menu", "multimedia", "networks", "pedagogy", "professional development", "programs", "reading", "reading materials", "recognition", "results", "support staff", "technical experts", "underlying assumptions", "universities", "users", "web"], "pubtype": [], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2305/618960PUB0Harn000public00BOX358355B.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2305/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2305", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:03:45Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2304": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2304/618950PUB0Heal000public00BOX358355B.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2304/618950PUB0Heal000public00BOX358355B.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Healthy Partnerships : How Governments Can Engage the Private Sector to Improve Health in Africa", "abstract": "Health systems across Africa are in urgent need of improvement. The public sector should not be expected to shoulder the burden of directly providing the needed services alone, nor can it, given the current realities of African health systems. Therefore to achieve necessary improvements, governments will need to rely more heavily on the private health sector. Indeed, private providers already play a significant role in the health sector in Africa and are expected to continue to play a key role, and private providers serve all income levels across sub- Saharan Africa's health systems. The World Health Organization (WHO) and others have identified improvements in the way governments interact with and make use of their private health sectors as one of the key ingredients to health systems improvements. Across the African region, many ministries of health are actively seeking to increase the contributions of the private health sector. However, relatively little is known about the details of engagement; that is, the roles and responsibilities of the players, and what works and what does not. A better understanding of the ways that governments and the private health sector work together and can work together more effectively is needed. This Report assesses and compares the ways in which African governments are engaging with their private health sectors. Engagement is defined, for the purposes of this report, to mean the deliberate, systematic collaboration of the government and the private health sector according to national health priorities, beyond individual interventions and programs. With effective engagement, one of the main constraints to better private sector contributions can be addressed, which in turn should improve the performance of health systems overall.", "uri":

"abstract": "Around the world, countries are becoming urbanized at an astonishing pace. As countries develop economically, their economies shift from mainly rural and agrarian to increasingly urban and nonagricultural. This rural-urban transformation presents both opportunities and challenges for development. When managed effectively, the transformation spurs growth and reduces poverty. When managed poorly, however, the process can result in stark welfare disparities, the marginalization of entire regions, and poorly functioning cities that fail to realize the potential gains from agglomeration economies. This book investigates the rural-urban transformation underway in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, emphasizing the influence of country conditions as well as the potential of good policies to minimize disparities and ensure that everyone shares in the benefits of urbanization. The first part of this book investigates urbanization and rural-urban welfare inequalities on three geographic scales global, national, and local featuring countries and cities in Sub-Saharan Africa on the national and local levels. The second part of the book sheds light on the texture of transformation in five countries in South Asia, each at a different stage in the process: Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.",

It also provides introductions to the methods used by ADePT and a step-by-step guide to their implementation in the program. ADePT is a software package that generates standardized tables and charts summarizing the results of distributional analyses of household survey data. ADePT health is just one of several modules; other modules include poverty, inequality, labor, social protection, and gender. ADePT health has two sub modules: health outcomes and health financing. Together these modules cover a wealth of topics in the areas of health equity and financial protection. This manual is divided into two parts corresponding to each of these sub modules. The following topics are covered: part 1, health outcomes: (a) measuring inequalities in outcomes and utilization (with and without standardization for need), (b) decomposing the causes of health sector inequalities, and (c) analyzing the incidence of government spending (that is, benefit incidence analysis); and part 2, health financing: (a) financial protection, including catastrophic payments and impoverishing payments, and (b) the progressivity and redistributive effect of health financing.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2306", "subjectTags": ["ability to pay", "ailments", "applicable law", "blood pressure", "capita health expenditure", "catastrophic health spending", "child health", "chronic condition", "determinants of health", "doctor", "doctors", "economic review", "employment", "epidemiology", "expenditures", "father", "female", "financial protection", "gender", "health care", "health care financing", "health care providers", "health care utilization", "health centers", "health data", "health determinants", "health economics", "health equity", "health expenditure", "health expenditures", "health facilities", "health finance", "health financing", "health indicators", "health inequalities", "health inequality", "health insurance", "health insurance scheme", "health organization", "health outcomes", "health sector", "health seeking behavior", "health services", "health status", "healthcare", "hospital admissions", "hospitals", "household budgets", "household expenditure", "household income", "illness", "illnesses", "immunization", "incidence analysis", "income", "income distribution", "income groups", "indexes", "inequities in health care", "infant mortality", "informal payments", "injury", "inpatient admission", "inpatient care", "inpatient treatment", "insurance", "insurance coverage", "living standards", "morbidity", "mortality", "mother", "national health", "national_health", "nutrition", "outpatient care", "patients", "pocket payments", "policy research", "primary health care", "public health", "public health care", "public health services", "public providers", "public sector", "public spending", "school health", "school health care", "social health insurance", "social security", "traditional medicine", "under-five mortality", "visits", "walking", "woman", "workers"], "pubtype": [], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2306/622580PUB0heal01476B0extop0id018459.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2306/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2306", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:03:46Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2301": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2301/618090PUB0ifc00Box358352B000PUBLIC0.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2301/618090PUB0ifc00Box358352B000PUBLIC0.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Assessing IFC's Poverty Focus and Results", "abstract": "Growth is good for the poor, but the impact of growth on poverty reduction depends on both the pace and the pattern of growth. A pattern of growth that enhances the ability of poor women and men to participate in, contribute to, and benefit from growth should not come at the expense of a slower pace of growth. Including the poor in the growth process is also good for the pace of growth. This relationship underscores the critical importance of the pattern of growth for poverty reduction. The International Finance Corporation's (IFC) mission is to create opportunities for people to escape poverty and improve their lives. It pursues this mission by promoting growth through support for private sector development. Attention to the type of growth that the institution supports is therefore critical for the fulfillment of its mission. IFC's approach in this respect has evolved over the years: from support to private sector-led growth in general, to promoting environmentally and socially sustainable growth, to, more recently, beginning to pay explicit attention to inclusive growth. There have been different perspectives of how IFC's support for private sector development is helping to tackle poverty. Yet, there is not enough clarity about what poverty means within the IFC context and how its interventions reach and affect the poor.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2301", "subjectTags": ["absolute poverty", "access to employment", "access to markets", "access to services", "accounting", "average incomes", "beneficiaries", "beneficiary", "beneficiary groups", "capacity building", "capacity building program", "capital base", "cas", "collateral", "collateral registries", "comparative advantage", "corrective actions", "country assistance strategies", "country level", "credit bureaus", "developing countries", "development bank", "development economics", "development goals", "development report", "development strategy", "dimensions of poverty", "disadvantaged groups", "dispute resolution", "distributional effects", "distributional pattern", "economic activities", "economic activity", "economic development", "economic growth", "economic opportunities", "empirical evidence", "empirical literature", "employment opportunities", "evaluation activities", "expenditures", "exporters", "farm employment", "financial infrastructure", "financial intermediaries", "financial markets", "financial sector", "financial support", "financial sustainability", "food prices", "foreign direct investment", "foreign direct investments", "frontier regions", "geographic targeting", "global business", "global partnership", "global trade", "gross domestic product", "growth pattern", "growth process", "growth rates", "human development", "incidence of poverty", "income", "income differential", "income generation", "income inequality", "infrastructure projects", "intangible", "international bank", "international development", "international finance", "intervention", "investment activities", "investment climate", "investment climates", "investment opportunities", "investment portfolio", "investment projects", "investment strategies", "learning", "livelihood", "livelihood opportunities", "livelihoods", "living standards", "market economies", "market failures", "market mechanisms", "measuring poverty", "microfinance", "microfinance institutions", "non-income dimensions", "nonexperimental design", "nongovernmental organizations", "payment systems", "per capita income", "poor", "poor countries", "poor families", "poor people", "poor women", "poverty characteristics", "poverty database", "poverty effects", "poverty focus", "poverty impact", "poverty impacts", "poverty index", "poverty maps", "poverty outcomes", "poverty rates", "poverty reduction", "poverty reduction objective", "poverty reduction objectives", "poverty reduction outcomes", "private financing", "private investment", "private investments", "pro-poor", "pro-poor growth", "programs", "project beneficiaries", "project objectives", "promoting growth", "public sector", "qualitative assessments", "rate of return", "rates of return", "reduced poverty", "reducing poverty", "reduction in poverty", "regional averages", "remote rural areas", "resource allocation", "returns", "risk management", "rural", "rural areas", "rural households", "rural investment", "rural poor", "sanitation", "sector activities", "securities", "securities markets", "service delivery", "settlement", "share of investment", "share of investments", "spatial distribution", "structural adjustment", "structural adjustment policies", "sustainable development", "sustainable growth", "targeting", "tax", "trade finance", "transition countries", "understanding of poverty", "urban areas", "vulnerable groups", "widespread poverty"], "pubtype": [], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2301/618090PUB0ifc00Box358352B000PUBLIC0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2301/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2301", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:03:38Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2300": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2300/616360PUB0REPL0d0EPI009780821382578.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2300/616360PUB0REPL0d0EPI009780821382578.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Leveraging Migration for Africa : Remittances, Skills, and Investments", "abstract": "International migration has profound implications for human welfare, and African governments have had only a limited influence on welfare outcomes, for good or ill.

The book comprises this introduction and summary and four chapters. Chapter one reviews the data on African migration and considers the challenges African governments face in managing migration. Chapter two discusses the importance of remittances, the most tangible link between migration and development; it also identifies policies that can facilitate remittance flows to Africa and increase their development impact. Chapter three analyzes high-skilled emigration and analyzes policies that can limit adverse implications and maximize positive implications for development. Chapter four considers ways in which Africa can leverage its diaspora resources to increase trade, investment, and access to technology.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2300", "subjectTags":

This book, in turn, is guide to assessing needs and then making essential decisions about what to do next. This book filled with practical strategies, tools, and guides covers both large-scale, formal needs assessments and less-formal assessments that guide daily decisions. Included in the book is a blend of rigorous methods and realistic tools that can help make informed and reasoned decisions. Together, these methods and tools offer a comprehensive, yet realistic, approach to identifying needs and selecting among alternative ways as go forward. Sections one and two offer quick, yet full, answers to many frequently asked questions regarding how to make justifiable decisions. Next, section three examines a variety of tools and techniques that can be used for both collecting information and making decisions. Appendix A then offers a number of checklists and guides for managing the systematic assessment processes that lead to quality decisions.

Recession", "abstract": "This volume combines the analyses of leading experts on the various elements affecting economic growth and the policies required to spur that growth. Ascent after Decline: Regrowing Global Economies after the Great Recession identifies the main challenges to the economic recovery, such as rising debt levels, reduced trade prospects, and global imbalances, as well as the obstacles to growth posed by fiscal conundrums and lagging infrastructure. It also examines the way forward, beginning with the role of the state and then covering labor markets, information technology, and innovation. The common thread throughout the book is the view that economic re-growth will depend in large measure on smart policy choices and that the role of government has never been more crucial than at any time since the great depression. As members of the World Bank community, these issues are of particular importance to us, since without a resurrection of strong economic growth in major economies, the likelihood of rapid economic development in poorer developing countries is dampened. This is troubling because we have seen progress in many parts of the globe in the past decade, including in Africa, and these gains will be arrested as long as the global economy is in disarray. Donors will withdraw, investment will retrench, and prospects will dim. This immiserizing welfare outcome is to be avoided. The volume is intended to shed light on those areas of policy that reduce the prospects of a prolonged period of stress and decline by 'regrowing growth.'", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2233",

Policy", "abstract": "The new structural economics argues that the best way to upgrade a country's endowment structure is to develop its industries at any specific time according to the comparative advantages determined by its given endowment structure at that time. The economy will be most competitive, the economic surplus will be the largest, and the capital accumulation and the upgrading of factor endowment structure will be the fastest possible. The 'New Structural Economics' presented in this book is an attempt to set out this third wave of development thinking. Taking into account the lessons learned from the growth successes and failures of the last decades, it advances a neoclassical approach to study the determinants and dynamics of economic structure. It postulates that the economic structure of an economy is endogenous to its factor endowment structure and that sustained economic development is driven by changes in factor endowments and continuous technological innovation. The paper also discusses binding constraints to growth in each of these industries' value chains as well as mechanisms through which governance-related issues in the implementation of industrial policy could be addressed.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2232", "subjectTags": ["growth"], "pubtype": [], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2232/663930PUB0EPI00nomics09780821389553.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2232/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2232", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T08:44:09Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2235": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2235/665200PUB0EPI00rkbook09780821388785.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2235/665200PUB0EPI00rkbook09780821388785.txt?sequence=2", "title": "A Workbook on Planning for Urban Resilience in the Face of Disasters : Adapting Experiences from Vietnam???s Cities to Other Cities", "abstract": "This workbook is intended to help policy makers in developing countries plan for a safer future in urban areas in the face of natural disasters and the consequences of climate change. It is based on the experiences of three cities in Vietnam, Can Tho, Dong Hoi, and Hanoi, that worked with international and local experts under World Bank supervision to develop local resilience action plans (LRAPs) in 2009-10. An LRAP is a detailed planning document that reflects local concerns and priorities based on the experiences of the past and projections for the future. It is not a wish list of projects that may never be completed because they are too costly or lack political support. Rather, it should be a realistic document that describes and establishes priorities for specific steps that can be undertaken in the near term to adapt to both climate related and other hazards. Regardless of their size, location, political orientation, or technical capacity, other cities can learn from the experiences of these pilot cities to develop their own LRAPs. The purpose of this workbook is to adapt the initial experiences of Can Tho, Dong Hoi, and Hanoi to benefit the national government and other communities in Vietnam and beyond. Indeed, the process described in this workbook was later adopted in the cities of Iloilo, the Philippines; Ningbo, China; and Yogyakarta, Indonesia, and the concluding chapter of this workbook draws on some of the lessons learned in these cities.

With growth stagnating and unemployment soaring in much of the world, educators are being asked to focus more on producing skills that feed into labor productivity and support the sustainable growth of employment and incomes. This timely volume contributes important new findings on the dynamics of education systems and labor market outcomes in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). It analyzes an important recent shift in labor market trends in LAC: the first decade of the 21st century has witnessed a marked decline in the earnings premia for university and secondary education. This, in turn, is contributing to reduced income inequality across the region. The recent trend contrasts with the sharp rise in tertiary earnings premia that was observed in the 1990s and that helped to reinforce high levels of income inequality in the region at that time. The authors recommend that, having achieved very large increases in secondary and tertiary enrollment, the region should now focus on improving the quality of its education systems and the pertinence of education curricula for the needs of the labor market. At age 15, the learning achievement of the average Latin American student still lags two years behind his or her Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) contemporary. The study opens up an important agenda for future research. While the evidence presented on the trends in education earnings premia is clear, the conclusions about the causes and significance of those trends are largely based on suggestive evidence for a limited number of countries, and are not definitive because of data limitations. The findings call for further in-depth analysis of the nature of skill mismatches, to inform policies that can strengthen the region's future economic growth by enhancing the productivity and earnings potential of the workforce.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2236", "subjectTags": ["able students", "acquisition of skills", "adult populations", "basic skills", "call", "cognitive skills", "college graduate", "curricula", "demand for education", "dropout rates", "early childhood", "economic growth", "educated workers", "education attainment", "education investment", "education level", "education levels", "education of children", "education programs", "education quality", "education spending", "education system", "education systems", "educational attainment", "educational attainments", "educational choices", "educational decisions", "educational expansion", "educational history", "educators", "effects of education", "enrollment", "expansion of education", "family life", "formal education", "generic skills", "grade levels", "high school", "household surveys", "human development", "indexes", "investment in education", "labor force", "labor market", "leadership", "learning", "learning achievement", "learning achievements", "learning needs", "learning outcomes", "let", "level of education", "levels of education", "literacy", "literacy skills", "mathematics", "negative effects", "new entrants", "nutrition", "occupations", "papers", "parental education", "parity", "peer review", "performance in mathematics", "personality", "poor performance", "primary education", "primary graduates", "quality of education", "reading", "returns to education", "rigorous analysis", "school dropout", "school dropouts", "school effects", "school graduate", "school graduates", "school level", "schooling", "schools", "secondary education", "secondary level", "secondary school", "significant challenges", "skill training", "skilled workers", "skilled workforce", "social behavior", "student achievement", "student assessment", "teachers", "teaching", "technical education", "tertiary education", "test scores", "training programs", "types of education", "university education", "vocational education", "young people"], "pubtype": ["Directions in Development ; human development"], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2236/665190PUB0EPI00skills09780821389713.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2236/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2236", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T08:44:15Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2238": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2238/666080PUB0EPI00sector09780821388570.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2238/666080PUB0EPI00sector09780821388570.txt?sequence=2", "title": "The Status of the Education Sector in Sudan", "abstract": "This publication is the first comprehensive overview of the education sector in Sudan.

Officially recorded remittances already amounted to almost a quarter of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2009. The 2008-09 global economic crises resulted in slower growth of remittance inflows in Nepal, leading directly to lower disposable income. This is a telling reminder of the importance of promoting a supportive environment for remittances. Nepali migration continues to increase as workers seek greater economic opportunities abroad. In this quest, Qatar is one of the important migration destinations for Nepali migrant workers. This report analyzes the migration and remittance transfer processes in the Qatar-Nepal Corridor in order to provide policy recommendations that would help improve the scale and impact of remittance transfers from Qatar to Nepal, and enhance the efficiency and integrity of migration and remittances in the corridor. The report identifies challenges in the migration process from Nepal to Qatar (related to high migration costs and their financing) and constraints in the remittance transfer process from Qatar to Nepal, which together limit the development and poverty reduction impact of remittance flows to Nepali households. As this report highlights, the Qatar-Nepal remittance corridor has several distinctive features. First, the majority of remittance flows from Qatar to Nepal are being transferred through officially regulated remittance channels. One of the reasons for this is actually the second feature of this corridor, namely, the officially managed migration process from Nepal to Qatar (as a result of which the majority of migrants are documented workers). The third feature is the contrast between the high competition and low prices of remittance services in this corridor on the one hand, and the contradictory rules and high costs incurred during the migration process on the other hand. Finally, as a by-product of the complex migration process which involves multiple players, financial transfers through informal mechanisms take place from Nepal to Qatar in order to pay the commissions of manpower agencies and middlemen.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2330", "subjectTags": ["abuse", "account-to-account", "accountability", "accounting", "anti-money laundering", "baby", "bank account", "bank accounts", "bank branch", "bank data", "bank drafts", "bank guarantee", "bank guarantees", "banking services", "banks", "best practices", "borrower", "branch network", "bus service", "cash transfer", "cash-to-cash", "central bank", "central banks", "checking accounts", "checks", "collateral", "collect cash", "courier services", "credit guarantee", "credit transfer", "credit transfers", "currency", "currency transaction", "debit cards", "default risk", "deposit", "deposit accounts", "deposits", "developing countries", "development bank", "development banks", "disbursement", "disbursements", "diseases", "dissemination", "due diligence", "economic conditions", "economic development", "economic growth", "economic opportunities", "electronic funds", "electronic funds transfer", "electronic transfers", "emigration", "employment", "exchange commission", "exchange rate", "exchange rate movements", "exchange rates", "family members", "financial flow", "financial information", "financial institution", "financial services", "financial stability", "foreign banks", "foreign currency", "foreign exchange", "foreign exchange rate", "foreign workers", "fraud", "gross domestic product", "host countries", "host country", "human development", "immigration", "income", "informal channels", "informal transfer", "informal transfers", "insurance", "integrity", "interest rates", "international bank", "international money orders", "international money transfer", "international money transfer operators", "issuance", "job opportunities", "labor force", "labor market", "lack of awareness", "laws", "legal frameworks", "legal status", "life insurance", "liquidity", "liquidity management", "liquidity risk", "liquidity risks", "living standard", "loan", "loan repayment", "local banks", "local currency", "local moneylenders", "market competition", "market conditions", "market players", "market share", "middleman", "middlemen", "migrant", "migrant labor", "migrant outflows", "migrant worker", "migrant workers", "migrant workforce", "migrants", "migration", "migration policies", "migration process", "mobile phone", "mobile phones", "monetary fund", "money express", "money gram", "money lender", "money order", "money orders", "money transfer", "money transfer companies", "money transfer operator", "money transfers", "national population", "nationals", "negotiable instruments", "payment services", "payment system", "payment systems", "physical cash transfer", "policy dialogue", "political instability", "political uncertainty", "population division", "population increase", "portfolio", "postal service", "private commercial banks", "pull factors", "push factors", "regulatory constraints", "regulatory framework", "regulatory frameworks", "remittance", "remittance flows", "remittance inflows", "remittance market", "remittance outflows", "remittance services", "remittance transfer", "remittance transfers", "remittances", "repatriation", "repayment", "reproductive health", "reserve", "reserve bank", "reserve bank of india", "reserves", "respect", "return", "rural areas", "savings", "savings accounts", "securities", "service provider", "service providers", "skilled workers", "skills development", "social development", "subsidiary", "tax", "tax deductions", "temporary migration", "terrorism", "trading", "transaction", "transaction costs", "transfer channels", "transfer costs", "transfer fee", "transfer fees", "transfer mechanisms", "transfer of funds", "transfer process", "transfer system", "transparency", "transport", "transportation", "unemployment", "unskilled workers", "wages", "wire transfers", "work migration"], "pubtype": ["World Bank Study"], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2330/634050PUB0Qata00Box0361515B0PUBLIC0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2330/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2330", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:04:14Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2331": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2331/634330PUB0Towa000public00BOX361512B.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2331/634330PUB0Towa000public00BOX361512B.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Toward Better Infrastructure : Conditions, Constraints, and Opportunities in Financing Public-Private Partnerships in Select African Countries", "abstract": "Examining innovative ways to address Africa's infrastructure deficit is at the heart of this analysis.

in Per Capita Financing Systems", "abstract": "This book reviews the experience with one specific though widely introduced approach to funding general education, namely per capita financing (PCF), in six countries in the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) region in an effort to learn which outcomes were achieved and how. Per capita financing is a type of formula funding of schools-funding characterized by a set of agreed objective criteria for allocating resources to schools, that provides schools fixed amounts of financing based on the numbers of students enrolled. Five of the six case study countries, Armenia, Estonia, Lithuania, Poland and the Russian Federation, were chosen primarily since they represent ECA countries with relatively long experience in implementing PCF schemes. The hope is that, as a result, the likelihood of observing the outcomes of per capita financing is higher. Since per capita financing replaced a school budget allocation process (input-based or normative budgeting) that was non-transparent and conducive to inefficient use and inequitable allocation of resources, the main expected outcomes of the per student finance reform were improved efficiency, equity, and transparency and accountability of public education expenditures.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2332", "subjectTags": ["education"], "pubtype": ["World Bank Study"], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2332/634340PUB0Refo0512B0EXTOP0ID0187830.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2332/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2332", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:04:17Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2333": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2333/634350PUB0Trad01512B0EXTOP0ID018788.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2333/634350PUB0Trad01512B0EXTOP0ID018788.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Trade Expansion through Market Connection : The Central Asian Markets of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan", "abstract": "The five countries of Central Asia expanded their trade significantly since beginning their transition with exports quadrupling to almost USD70 billion between 2003 and 2008 but without substantial diversification.

After years of stagnation, economic growth has spurted gross domestic product (GDP) grew from an annual average rate of less than 2 percent in 1978-95 to nearly 6 percent over 2003-08. Inflation is half its level of the mid-1990s. Private capital flows have risen to $50 billion, exceeding foreign aid. Exports are growing, as is private sector activity. The number of democratic regimes has risen and the security situation has improved. The poverty rate is falling by 1 percentage point a year. Countries such as Ethiopia, Ghana, Mauritania, and Rwanda are on track to reach many of the millennium development goals. Nine African countries have achieved or are on track to achieve the target for extreme poverty. Among other encouraging trends are more fair and effective leadership, an improving business climate, increasing innovation, a more involved citizenry, and growing reliance on home-grown solutions. More and more, Africans are driving African development. This increased dynamism in Sub-Saharan Africa is evident across a broad swath of countries. It has created optimism that Africa's favorable development performance will be long lasting and that it could dramatically transform countries in the region. Along the way, the prevailing discourse on Africa's economic development has shifted from whether the region will develop to how the region is developing. After a review of the major recent economic developments in Africa, this overview describes the approach and methodology used in the study of African successes.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2335", "subjectTags": ["development achievements", "development challenges", "development progress", "lessons"], "pubtype": [], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2335/634310PUB0Yes0061512B09780821387450.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2335/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2335", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:04:20Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2336": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2336/634380PUB00pub01518B0EXTOP0ID018840.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2336/634380PUB00pub01518B0EXTOP0ID018840.txt?sequence=2", "title": "The Political Economy of Decentralization Reforms : Implications for Aid Effectiveness", "abstract": "This volume presents a preliminary framework designed to help international development partners consider the relevance of political economy issues for their programmatic support to decentralization and local government reform. The intention is neither to advocate decentralization in general or in any particular form, nor to presume or privilege any particular decentralization objective. Instead, the purpose is to document the potential value of better understanding how (primarily national and intergovernmental) political and institutional dynamics do or could affect the scope for realizing decentralization reforms aligned with commonly advocated service delivery, governance, and poverty reduction goals. The underlying premise is that systematic analysis of these issues can productively complement the dominantly technical diagnostic work typically carried out by development partners. Specifically, development partners can benefit from better understanding the practical significance of motives that drive politicians and bureaucrats to support or oppose reform at various stages of the decentralization process, from making an initial reform decision to detailed design and implementation. In addition, the framework addresses how these incentives can weaken, strengthen, or shift in response to changes in political and economic conditions that arise after reform begins. A general approach to conducting political economy of decentralization analysis is outlined, recognizing the need to tailor such analysis to the particular country context. This volume is based on literature reviews and knowledge derived from selected country experiences.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2336", "subjectTags": ["accountability", "administrative costs", "administrative decentralization", "autonomy", "bailouts", "brokers", "budget deficits", "bureaucracy", "central government", "central governments", "centralizing", "civil society", "comparative analysis", "constitutional reforms", "decentralization", "decentralization objective", "decentralization objectives", "decentralization policies", "decentralization policy", "decentralization process", "decentralization reform", "decentralized services", "decision making", "democracies", "democracy", "developing countries", "development strategy", "devolution", "district", "districts", "durable", "economic conditions", "economic development", "economic models", "federalism", "fiscal decentralization", "futures", "government decentralization", "government reform", "governors", "holding", "inflationary pressures", "instrument", "intergovernmental relations", "intergovernmental transfer", "international bank", "international development", "judicial independence", "judicial institutions", "labor unions", "legal framework", "legal frameworks", "legislation", "levy", "local authorities", "local councils", "local government", "local governments", "local officials", "market reforms", "mayors", "ministry of interior", "monetary fund", "moral hazard", "municipal governments", "municipalities", "policy goals", "political control", "political decentralization", "political economy", "political parties", "political system", "political systems", "politicians", "post-decentralization", "price changes", "provinces", "provincial councils", "provincial governments", "public budgeting", "public expenditures", "public policy", "returns", "revenue sharing", "service delivery", "social relations", "state governors", "subnational", "subnational authorities", "subnational elections", "subnational government", "subnational government autonomy", "subnational governments", "subnational jurisdictions", "subnational regions", "subsidiary", "taxation", "transport", "turnover", "urbanization", "village", "voters", "wealth"], "pubtype": ["Directions in Development ; public sector governance"], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2336/634380PUB00pub01518B0EXTOP0ID018840.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2336/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2336", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:04:21Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2337": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2337/637230PUB00pub00ID0187990BOX361521B.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2337/637230PUB00pub00ID0187990BOX361521B.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Barriers to Trade in Services in the CEFTA Region", "abstract": "This paper describes the economic importance of the service sector in Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) countries and current barriers to trade in services between CEFTA countries. It looks at four sectors: construction, land transport, legal services, and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) services. The intent is to stimulate dialogue on trade in services between decision-makers in CEFTA countries. In CEFTA economies, export of services accounts for about 10 percent of GDP in non coastal countries and much more in coastal countries, where foreign currency earnings from tourism are the dominant form of service = exports. Though CEFTA countries have opened their markets considerably, mostly because they are pursuing accession to the European Union (EU) and the World Trade Organization (WTO), there are still obstacles to trade in services. Some, such as the movement of professional workers, are general; others are sector-specific. In what follows, the next section illustrates the importance of the services sectors in CEFTA economies and analyzes trends in services trade and in intraregional trade for countries that have such data available. The third section describes general barriers to trade in services, and specific barriers for the four sectors specified. The analysis reviews the legal and institutional framework for trade in services and features assessments by regional companies that export such services.

Equally, the emerging impacts of global warming on natural disasters and on agriculture are warning signs of the urgency to care for the environment and society. Recent global experience in the financial and environmental arenas demonstrates clearly the need to put in place and enforce regulatory frameworks that balance costs and benefits, both private and social. In this context, the crucial questions in the recent evaluation by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) of the World Bank Group's safeguards and sustainability policy framework concern the effectiveness of the instrument in mitigating adverse environmental and social impacts of development programs, and suggesting ways to improve the results. IEG's evaluation covered projects approved from FY1999 to FY2008. During this period, social and environmental effects were significant in half of World Bank projects 1,402 with commitments of $109 billion; 88 percent of projects financed by the International Finance Corporation (IFC)  1,662 with commitments of $35 billion; and 217 guarantees by the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). The main thrust of the evaluation findings is that the World Bank Group's safeguards and sustainability policies have helped avoid or mitigate large-scale social and environmental risks in the projects it financed, but many projects with substantial environmental and social impacts remain of concern primarily because of inadequate supervision and follow-up.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2339", "subjectTags": ["abatement", "access to information", "accountabilities", "accountability", "adb", "adequate disclosure", "advisory services", "agricultural sectors", "allocative efficiency", "bank lending", "bank management", "benefit analysis", "borrower", "borrowing", "capacity building", "civil society", "climate change", "comparative analysis", "complaints", "conflict of interest", "conflicts of interest", "cost analysis", "cost effectiveness", "cost savings", "crises", "current costs", "development assistance", "development bank", "development effectiveness", "displacement", "division of labor", "economic growth", "eib", "empirical evidence", "environmental", "environmental impacts", "environmental management", "environmental performance", "environmental policies", "environmental sustainability", "equities", "equity investments", "exclusion", "expenditure", "externalities", "financial institutions", "financial intermediaries", "financial intermediary", "gender", "government expenditures", "guarantee agency", "income", "indigenous peoples", "inflation", "institutional capacity", "institutional reforms", "international finance", "international law", "international laws", "investment bank", "laws", "legislation", "lending policies", "lending portfolio", "living standards", "moral hazard", "multilateral development banks", "negative externalities", "ombudsman", "peer review", "pollution", "poor client", "private investments", "private sector financing", "real sector", "refugees", "remedy", "reorganization", "resource allocation", "resource management", "resource use", "safety", "savings", "social benefits", "social costs", "social development", "structural adjustment", "supply chain", "supply chains", "sustainable development", "technical support", "transport", "working conditions"], "pubtype": ["Evaluation Brief ; No. 15"], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2339/636830PUB00WB000Box0361524B0PUBLIC0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2339/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2339", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:04:23Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2288": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2288/608070PUB0Fina10Box358332B01PUBLIC1.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2288/608070PUB0Fina10Box358332B01PUBLIC1.txt?sequence=2", "title": "International Financial Reporting Standards : A Practical Guide, Sixth Edition", "abstract": "An acceptable coherent framework of fundamental accounting principles is essential for preparing financial statements.

In seeking this objective, the report also addresses correlates and the processes that explain how and why these groups have fared the way they have over a period of time. Chapter two in this report focuses on the Adivasis or STs. In most analyses, this topic is addressed after the Dalits, but the author has placed it first for analytical and organizational purposes. There are two reasons for this: tribal groups are not strictly within the caste system, and the bonds of rituals do not affect their relations with the world in general. Also the report shows that outcomes among Adivasis are among the worst, despite considerable variation across places of residence and tribal groupings. Finally, Chapter three focuses on Dalits, a term that has united the SCs in a process that is more empowering than the process of identification by individual names, which have been and continue to be

Demand for electricity increased steadily with gross domestic product (GDP). GDP grew, on average, 6.5 percent between 2000 and 2007, and electricity consumption per capita grew 2.75 percent. Meanwhile, energy security and supply reliability were a growing concern for policymakers and planners. Despite increased access to financing through the opening of international financial markets, under-maintenance of old soviet-era power sector infrastructure created a backlog of critical investments threatening the stability of the sector. As a result, a gap between demand and available supply capacity was beginning to emerge.

What became apparent was that a number of challenges had already been identified, but that trying to capture lessons learned on effective strategies was difficult, because of the failure to agree upon a unique and coherent definition of ECB, its various objectives and wide scope, and the diversity of institutional contexts in which it takes place.

A new consensus has also emerged that reducing trade costs and improving access to corridors is not just a matter of building infrastructure. The policies that regulate transport services providers and the movement of goods along corridors are important determinants of the social rate of return on such infrastructure investment. This book avoids optimistic assumptions regarding the prospects for new high-level agreements and decisions to facilitate transit or the possible benefits from increased use of technology. Instead, the authors argue that much can be done through the implementation of readily available existing tools. The use of these tools is often hampered by not only capacity constraints; but, equally if not more important, a lack of commitment. Political economic factors in both the landlocked countries and their transit neighbors must be recognized and addressed. This book offers examples of possible implementation strategies that, while challenging, should in principle help in overcoming these political economic constraints. The main message is that to bring about efficient trade corridors governments and stakeholders should focus on properly implementing the fiscal, regulatory, and procedural principles for international transit that encourage quality-driven logistics services. The various implementation challenges are the primary focus of this book.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2286", "subjectTags": ["adb", "adverse effects", "aim", "air", "air freight", "air transport", "alternative transport", "alternative transport modes", "average transit time", "benchmarks", "bilateral trade", "border crossing", "border crossings", "border management", "bottlenecks", "boxes", "bridge", "cargo", "carriage", "carriers", "cif", "commodities", "commodity", "community transport", "competitiveness", "congestion", "container services", "containers", "cost of transportation", "costs of transportation", "customs", "customs brokers", "customs clearance", "customs duties", "deliveries", "delivery times", "demurrage", "development assistance", "development policy", "diesel", "diesel fuel", "drivers", "economic conditions", "economic constraints", "economic cooperation", "economic integration", "economic performance", "efficient transport", "exports", "feasibility studies", "financial crisis", "financial institutions", "forwarding", "freight", "freight bureaus", "freight costs", "freight forwarders", "freight movement", "freight service", "freight services", "freight traffic", "freight transport", "fuel consumption", "fuel shortages", "gatt", "handling", "highway", "highway corridor", "highway network", "highway project", "highway systems", "implementation strategies", "income levels", "inflation", "infrastructure capacity", "infrastructure costs", "infrastructure development", "infrastructure investment", "infrastructure projects", "infrastructures", "inland waterway", "inland waterway transport", "inland waterways", "inspection", "insurance", "international carriage of goods", "international trade", "international transit", "international transport", "international union of railways", "inventories", "inventory", "itc", "land transport", "landlocked countries", "ldcs", "leasing contracts", "legal framework", "legislation", "loading", "logistics costs", "long-distance", "manufacturing", "monopoly", "national transport", "natural resources", "optimization", "passengers", "penalties", "per capita income", "political economy", "port authority", "port of entry", "price differential", "productivity", "profit margins", "purchasing power", "quality of transport", "rail", "rail operators", "rail transit", "rail transport", "railroads", "railway", "regional development banks", "regional road transport", "regional transit", "resource mobilization", "risk management", "road", "road conditions", "road freight rates", "road infrastructure", "road investment", "road network", "road quality", "road transport", "road transport prices", "road transport services", "road use", "roads", "route", "routes", "seaports", "shipments", "shippers", "shipping", "subsidiary", "supply chains", "surcharges", "tax", "technical assistance", "toll", "tolls", "trade facilitation", "trade flows", "trade logistics", "trade performance", "trade volume", "traffic", "transit", "transit corridor", "transit corridors", "transit countries", "transit information", "transit infrastructure", "transit institutions", "transit policy", "transit system", "transit system performance", "transit systems", "transit times", "transit trade", "transit trip", "transport agencies", "transport agreement", "transport corridors", "transport costs", "transport facilitation", "transport industry", "transport infrastructure", "transport investment", "transport markets", "transport policies", "transport policy", "transport projects", "transport services", "transport strategies", "transportation", "transportation corridors", "transportation costs", "transports", "truck capacity", "truck traffic", "truck use", "trucks", "true", "vehicle", "vehicle operating", "vehicle operating costs", "vehicle regulations", "vehicles", "volume of traffic", "waiting time", "warehousing", "water navigation", "world trade organization", "wto"], "pubtype": ["Directions in Development ;

By early 2009, it was clear that this economic downturn would be more severe than any crisis since the great depression, prompting some to it as the 'great recession.' Eastern European and Central Asian countries were hit particularly hard during 2009, global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) contracted for the first time since Second World War. The financial crisis and the ensuing economic downturn, the worst since the Great Depression in the 1930s, went hand in hand with tightening of credit markets, bank failures, firm closures, and high demand for social safety nets. This report, The jobs crisis: household and Government responses to the great recession in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, brings together evidence that World Bank teams have collected on the impact of the crisis on households and families in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. This report shows how the crisis was felt by Eastern European and Central Asian households. Not only did unemployment rise sharply but it also lasted longer. The report also shows that the pain of the recession was broader, with workers taking home smaller paychecks as firms offered lower wage rates and fewer hours of work to their workers. The jobs crisis finds that households used a variety of ways to cope with the crisis. The jobs crisis presents an account of how governments reacted to the crisis through social policy reforms and initiatives and how such responses could be improved in the future. Unemployment insurance benefits played a particularly important cushioning role, but coverage of the unemployed tended to be limited.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2287", "subjectTags": ["accruals", "active labor", "active labor market", "active labor market program", "active labor market programs", "assistance programs", "automatic stabilizer", "bank failures", "beneficiaries", "borrowing", "budget deficits", "capital flows", "capital investments", "central governments", "child labor", "consolidation", "coping strategies", "country-specific factors", "covariate shocks", "credit markets", "debt", "development bank", "durable goods", "economic crises", "economic downturn", "economic downturns", "economic growth", "economic recovery", "education programs", "educational attainment", "educational services", "eligibility criteria", "employability", "employment growth", "employment offices", "employment prospects", "employment protection legislation", "employment reduction", "ethnic groups", "ethnic minorities", "family labor", "financial crises", "financial crisis", "financial markets", "firing costs", "fiscal constraints", "fiscal deficits", "fiscal discipline", "flexible labor markets", "food expenditures", "food security", "foreign labor", "government health", "gross domestic product", "gross wages", "health expenditures", "health insurance", "high employment", "high unemployment", "high unemployment rates", "household characteristics", "household enterprise", "household income", "household savings", "household surveys", "household wealth", "household welfare", "human capital", "human capital investments", "human development", "idiosyncratic shocks", "income losses", "income shocks", "income support", "inflation", "inflation rates", "inflexible labor", "informal credit", "informal safety nets", "informal sector", "informal transfers", "insurance program", "international bank", "job loss", "job losses", "job seekers", "job vacancy", "jobs", "jobs crises", "jobs crisis", "labor adjustment", "labor costs", "labor demand", "labor force", "labor force participation", "labor laws", "labor market", "labor market adjustment", "labor market conditions", "labor market policy", "labor market regulations", "labor markets", "labor programs", "labor regulations", "labor supply", "labor union", "labour", "layoff", "layoffs", "leave of absence", "local government", "local governments", "long-term unemployment", "low employment", "macroeconomic conditions", "macroeconomic crisis", "macroeconomic shocks", "manpower", "manpower policy", "manufacturing industries", "market economies", "market economy", "medical care", "medical insurance", "minimum income", "minimum wage", "ministries of finance", "mitigation strategies", "monetary fund", "moral hazard", "natural disasters", "new entrants", "nutritional status", "opportunity costs", "part-time employment", "passive labor", "passive labor market programs", "penalties", "pension", "pensions", "pocket expenses", "policy responses", "poor", "poverty reduction", "preventative health", "preventive care", "primary school", "private sector", "product market", "product markets", "profitability", "program design", "public employment", "public savings", "public spending", "public works", "public works programs", "real wage", "real wages", "recessions", "remittance", "remittances", "retirement", "safety", "safety net", "safety net programs", "safety nets", "savings", "self employment", "service sector", "severance pay", "shock", "skilled workers", "social assistance", "social benefits", "social fund", "social impacts", "social investment", "social policy", "social programs", "social protection", "social safety nets", "social security", "social transfers", "structural reforms", "structural unemployment", "subsidiary", "targeting", "temporary employment", "total employment", "total workers", "unemployed", "unemployed people", "unemployed workers", "unemployment", "unemployment benefits", "unemployment figures", "unemployment insurance", "unemployment insurance benefits", "unemployment office", "vulnerable groups", "vulnerable households", "wage bill", "wage levels", "wage rate", "wage rates", "wage subsidies", "wage subsidy", "wage subsidy programs", "wage workers", "war", "work experience", "worker", "workers", "working hours", "younger workers", "youth unemployment", "youth unemployment rate", "youth unemployment rates"], "pubtype": ["Directions in development ;

The book is organized into eleven chapters. Chapter one outlines the troubling financial market conditions at home and abroad before the crisis. Chapter two then delves into the origin of the crisis and offers analyses on the shortcomings of the Korean economy and the instability of the international financial system. In chapter three, policy measures the government executed in the wake of the onset of the crisis are described and analyzed. Chapter four probes the steps taken to reduce the risk of sovereign insolvency in the face of the cool market reaction to the initial package of crisis response measures announced by the International Monetary Fund in December 1997. Chapter five describes the background within which the government established the institutional framework necessary for corporate, financial, and labor market restructuring between December 1997 and April 1998. The government efforts to secure additional foreign currency liquidity through the markets and to devise initiatives to counter the massive unemployment are discussed in detail. In chapter six, the situation during May and June 1998 is explored with a focus on the closure of nonviable corporate and financial companies and the efforts to drive down interest rates and revive credit flows. This is followed, in chapter seven, by an analysis of the first phase of financial sector restructuring, which started in the third quarter of 1998, and the measures adopted to shore up potential growth and cope with the pressing problem of unemployment. Chapters eight and nine deal separately with the restructuring of the top five chaebols (the large family-controlled and family-run groups that dominate business in Korea), the economic stimulus packages applied during the fourth quarter of 1998, the efforts to restore financial market stability and economic growth, and the initial phase of foreign exchange liberalization measures, which were implemented during the first half of 1999. Chapter ten then discusses the situation during the second half of 1999, with a particular focus on the collapse of the Daewoo business group, including the steps taken to contain the resulting fallout, as well as measures aimed at expanding the economic recovery. Chapter eleven, the final chapter, offers a diagnosis of the Korean economy, along with an analysis of the policy implications and the responses for the future.", "uri":

"abstract": "This volume is an introduction to the theories and policies that affect economic growth and poverty. It is a compilation of lecture notes used in face-to-face and e-learning courses presented by the World Bank Institute's (WBI) Poverty Program during 2004-08. The volume is divided into three parts. Part one discusses basic concepts and measurement issues pertaining to poverty, national income, and economic growth. Part two deals with the macroeconomic policies that are critical for economic growth in the short term. It covers government enforced fiscal and exchange-rate policies and the roles of financial institutions, development assistance (or aid), debt relief, and trade policies. Part three covers the structural and sectoral policies that affect longer-term economic growth and poverty reduction. To underscore the impact of good governance and effective service delivery in growth and poverty reduction, separate chapters are devoted to institutional and technological development, education, health, labor, and land. The volume ends with a chapter that summarizes knowledge of growth theory, reviews the process of growth in 13 successful countries, and draws out implications for other developing countries. The authors hope that this chapter may be of help to policy makers in identifying the constraints to economic growth and development that may be unique to each country.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2281", "subjectTags": ["access to loans", "administrative assistance", "adult mortality", "adult population", "aged", "aggregate poverty", "agricultural produce", "aids epidemic", "average household income", "bank office", "basic needs", "benefits of migration", "business ownership", "capital investment", "caribbean region", "cash expenditures", "chronic illness", "citizens", "consumption aggregate", "consumption expenditure", "consumption per capita", "consumption smoothing", "coping strategy", "counterfactual", "country of destination", "cultural barriers", "decline in poverty", "demographic characteristics", "demographic composition", "developing countries", "development bank", "dissemination", "divorce", "domestic labor", "drought", "earnings", "economic development", "economic growth", "economic opportunities", "economic shocks", "education level", "education levels", "employer", "employment opportunities", "exclusion", "expatriates", "exploitation", "export markets", "families", "family members", "fertility", "financial constraints", "financial cost", "food consumption", "food consumption per capita", "foreign direct investment", "full potential of migration", "gender", "global development", "government policies", "government policy", "gross domestic product", "head of household", "hiv", "household assets", "household budget", "household consumption", "household expenditures on food", "household head", "household head age", "household income", "household level", "household number", "household size", "household survey", "household welfare", "housing", "human capital", "husband", "husbands", "illness", "immigration", "immigration policies", "impact of migration", "imperfect information", "income distribution", "income dynamics", "income gains", "income groups", "income growth", "income inequality", "inheritance", "insurance", "interest rates", "international bank", "international migrant", "international migrants", "international migration", "intervention", "isolation", "job opportunities", "kinship", "kinship networks", "labor market", "labor market activities", "labor markets", "labor mobility", "lack of credit", "lack of finance", "lack of information", "land holdings", "land value", "legal status", "limited access", "living standards", "loan", "low-income countries", "malaria", "market failures", "marketing", "medical treatment", "migrant", "migrant workers", "migrants", "migration", "migration process", "millennium development goals", "ministry of health", "moneylenders", "mother", "mountain region", "national borders", "natural disasters", "per capita consumption", "permanent migration status", "physical capital", "policy implications", "policy makers", "policy research", "policy research working paper", "political economy", "political instability", "poor", "poor households", "poor individuals", "poor people", "poor rural regions", "poorer households", "population and development", "population growth", "poverty data", "poverty dynamics", "poverty impact", "poverty indicators", "poverty levels", "poverty line", "poverty linkages", "poverty rate", "poverty rates", "poverty reduction", "practitioners", "production process", "progress", "public policy", "pull factors", "purchasing power", "purchasing power parity", "push factors", "qualitative data", "reduction in poverty", "regional capital", "regional labor", "regional labor markets", "regional office", "remittance", "remittances", "remote areas", "remote locations", "resource allocation", "respect", "return migration", "risk sharing", "rural", "rural area", "rural areas", "rural migration", "rural regions", "rural villages", "savings", "schooling", "sex", "siblings", "social networks", "social norms", "social policy", "social protection", "socioeconomic status", "source of income", "source of opportunities", "spillover", "spouse", "teens", "temporary migrants", "temporary migration", "traditional values", "undocumented migration", "unemployment", "urban areas", "urban center", "urban migration", "urbanization", "use per capita", "village", "violence", "young adults"], "pubtype": ["Directions in Development ;

The crisis was associated with a great trade collapse, the sharpest in recorded history and the deepest since Second World War (Baldwin 2009). The trade collapse affected all countries and products, although to different extents. While signs of recovery are starting to solidify, deeper questioning of the causes of the crisis and the merits of globalization has surfaced. The emergence of China and the imbalances of its trade with the United States are shaking the stability of the global system. Are these imbalances sustainable, or do they need to be adjusted to avoid another global crisis? What impact will these adjustments have on the trade of developing countries if they mean that China consumes more and the United States saves more? Openness has helped support growth in many countries, to unprecedented levels in Brazil, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, and others. Yet today many are concerned that openness is creating vulnerability, and vulnerability can hurt growth. No one believes that inward orientation is the solution or that domestic consumption alone can boost growth, even in large countries. The longer-term benefits of openness more than compensate for the short-term negative impacts of trade shocks. The question is not whether to remain open but rather what kind of safety and insurance systems, at the micro and macro levels, to put in place to better hedge against shocks from globalization. As developing countries try to find answers to these questions, they also face a drastically changed trade environment. The crisis proved that protectionism is no longer the name of the game; it remained largely under control thanks to a solid multilateral regime as well as to a new system of production sharing across countries, which does not lend itself naturally to broad-based protectionism. Moreover, the role of South-South trade is growing, giving developing countries new opportunities to export and new opportunities to import cheaper capital goods, now produced in countries like China or India, that allow them to industrialize faster. Thus, while outward-oriented growth is here to stay, it needs to be put in a different perspective and packaged with additional policies. As the world emerges from the crisis, the author expect to see the development of an 'export-led growth version 2.0' model that reflects these new dynamics.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2283", "subjectTags": ["crisis"], "pubtype": ["Trade and Development"], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2283/608100PUB0Mana10Box358332B01PUBLIC1.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2283/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2283", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:03:12Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2326": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2326/632520PUB0Exto00public00BOX361512B0.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2326/632520PUB0Exto00public00BOX361512B0.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Assessing Sector Performance and Inequality in Education : Streamlined Analysis with ADePT Software", "abstract": "This book gathers in one volume all the information related to Automated DEC [Development Economics - Vice Presidency at the World Bank] Poverty Tables (ADePT) Edu, the software platform created by the World Bank for reporting and analyzing education indicators and education inequality.

Across the continent, the availability and quality of service have gone up and the cost has gone down. In just 10 years dating from the end of the 1990s mobile network coverage rose from 16 percent to 90 percent of the urban population; by 2009, rural coverage stood at just under 50 percent of the population. Although the performance of Africa's mobile networks over the past decade has been remarkable, the telecommunications sector in the rest of the world has also evolved rapidly. Many countries now regard broadband Internet as central to their long-term economic development strategies, and many companies realize that the use of ICT is the key to maintaining profitability. This book is about that challenge and others. Chapters two and three describe the recent history of the telecommunications market in Africa; they cover such issues as prices, access, the performance of the networks, and the regulatory reforms that have triggered much of the investment. This part of the book compares network performance across the region and tries to explain why some countries have moved so much more quickly than others in providing affordable telecommunications services. Chapter four explores the financial side of the telecommunications revolution in Africa and details how the massive investments have been financed and which companies have most influenced the sector. Chapter five deals with the future of the sector. The final chapter synthesizes the main chapters of the book and presents policy recommendations intended to drive the sector forward.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2325", "subjectTags": ["access to electricity", "aluminum", "annual carbon dioxide emissions", "approach", "availability", "average tariff", "backup power", "blackouts", "block tariff", "border infrastructure", "border trade", "border transmission", "capacity expansion", "capital costs", "capital expenditures", "capital investment", "capital investments", "car", "carbon", "carbon dioxide", "carbon dioxide emissions", "certified emission reduction", "climate change", "co", "coal", "coal reserves", "colors", "compensation mechanisms", "concessions", "consumption of electricity", "cost of power", "cost recovery", "costs of power", "dams", "demand for power", "diesel", "diesel generators", "diesel power", "distribution network", "domestic energy", "domestic energy resources", "dominant fuel", "driving", "drought", "economic costs", "economic development", "economic growth", "economic integration", "economies of scale", "electric power", "electrical power", "electricity consumption", "electricity demand", "electricity generation", "electricity prices", "electricity production", "electricity sector", "electricity services", "electricity supply", "electricity tariff", "emission", "emission reduction credit", "emissions reductions", "emissions savings", "energy policy", "energy resources", "environmental benefits", "environmental impacts", "excess capacity", "fares", "fossil", "fossil fuels", "fuel", "fuel oil", "fuel prices", "fuels", "gas", "gas production", "gas resources", "gasoline", "generating capacity", "generation", "generation capacity", "generation costs", "generation of electricity", "geothermal plants", "geothermal power", "global carbon dioxide", "global carbon dioxide emissions", "government policy", "greenhouse", "greenhouse gas", "greenhouse gas emissions", "greenhouse gases", "grid power", "gross domestic product", "growth rates", "heat", "heat production", "heavy fuel oil", "household budgets", "household consumption", "hydroelectric plants", "hydropower", "hydropower generation", "infrastructure costs", "infrastructure development", "infrastructure financing", "infrastructure funding", "infrastructure investment", "infrastructure services", "infrastructure spending", "international energy", "investment climate", "investment costs", "investment requirements", "kerosene", "kilowatt hour", "kilowatt-hour", "lease contracts", "load shedding", "lower tariffs", "management contracts", "marginal cost of electricity", "marginal costs", "methane", "natural gas", "nuclear power", "nuclear power plant", "o&m", "oil", "oil prices", "oil production", "oil reserves", "pe", "performance indicators", "petroleum", "power", "power capacity", "power consumption", "power corporation", "power costs", "power crisis", "power demand", "power development", "power generation", "power generation capacity", "power grid", "power markets", "power outages", "power plants", "power pools", "power prices", "power production", "power project", "power projects", "power sector", "power sector planning", "power sector reform", "power shortages", "power stations", "power supplies", "power supply", "power system", "power systems", "power trade", "power trading", "pp", "prepayment", "price differential", "price of oil", "price of power", "private sector participation", "profit margin", "propane", "public infrastructure", "public private infrastructure", "reduction in emissions", "regional infrastructure", "renewable energy", "renewable energy resources", "residential customers", "revenue collection", "routes", "rural electrification", "sanitation", "service expansion", "shipping containers", "surplus power", "tariff structures", "thermal capacity", "thermal energy", "thermal power", "thermal power plants", "tin", "total emissions", "trading patterns", "transmission capacity", "transmission grid", "transmission system", "transport", "transport policy", "transportation", "uranium", "utilities", "utility bill", "utility load", "vehicle", "voltage", "water resource management", "weather patterns", "wind"], "pubtype": ["Direction in Development ;

The extent of the trade collapse was unprecedented: trade flows fell at a faster rate than had been observed even in the early years of the great depression. G-20 leaders held their first crisis-related summit in November 2008. The goal was to understand the root causes of the global crisis and to reach consensus on actions to address its immediate effects. In the case of trade, a key question concerned the extent to which a drying up of trade finance caused the observed decline in trade flows. This book brings together a range of projects and studies undertaken by development institutions, export credit agencies, private bankers, and academics to shed light on the role of trade finance in the 2008-09 great trade collapse. It provides policy makers, analysts, and other interested parties with analyses and assessments of the role of governments and institutions in restoring trade finance markets. A deeper understanding of the complexity of trade finance remains critical as the world economy recovers and the supply of trade finance improves. The international community continues to know too little about the fragility of low income economies in response to trade finance developments and shocks, as well as about the ability and conditions of access to trade finance by small and medium enterprises and small banks in developing countries. Similarly, there is uncertainty regarding the impact on trade finance of recent changes in the third Basel regulatory framework.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2324", "subjectTags": ["access to

The social dimension of the dismal growth performance is well captured in the poverty rates. According to World Bank statistics, in the first half of the 1990s the average poverty rate in the region was close to 60 percent in countries such as Honduras and Nicaragua; almost three-quarters of the population lived on less than US$4 a day. Several lessons emerge from getting the most out of free trade agreements (FTAs) in Central America, but the author will like to stress three. First, Central America should not take the positive results of signed FTAs as a given. Second, trade promotion needs to be complemented by a strong focus on the poor. In some cases, this focus is because of the challenges brought by additional external competition, which may negatively affect some industries or sectors. Third, is the need for more competitive markets? Although many of us tend to think about the benefits of growth in terms of quantities (that is, more exports, more employment, and increased access to goods) many of the welfare effects of FTAs are transmitted through prices (such as lower prices for imported goods).", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2322", "subjectTags": ["trade"], "pubtype": ["Directions in Development ; trade"], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2322/632610PUB0Free00ID0187120BOX361512B.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2322/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2322", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:04:04Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2321": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2321/632600PUB0Fina00ID0186820BOX361512B.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2321/632600PUB0Fina00ID0186820BOX361512B.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Financing Health Care in East Asia and the Pacific : Best Practices and Remaining Challenges", "abstract": "This is an exciting time in East Asia and the Pacific region.

What this estimate does not capture are the societal costs of corruption and the devastating impact of such crimes on victim countries. Theft of assets by corrupt officials, often at the highest levels of government, weakens confidence in public institutions, damages the private investment climate, and divests needed funding available for core investment in such poverty alleviation measures as public health, education, and infrastructure.

Preferential trade agreements (PTAs) have become a central instrument of regional integration in all parts of the world. Beyond market access and the progressive elimination of barriers at the border, PTAs are increasingly being used to address a host of behind-the-border issues, also known as 'deep integration' issues, in order to promote cooperation in the areas of investment, trade facilitation, competition policy, and government procurement, as well as wider social issues related to the regulation of the environment and the protection of labor and human rights. The purpose of this handbook is to explore the various ways in which policy makers and trade negotiators in the developing world can limit the costs and maximize the benefits of their regional integration efforts. PTAs have become a cornerstone of the international trade system. The surge in their number and scope is fast reshaping the architecture of the world trading system and the trading environment of developing countries. The integration of these diverse agreements into a multilateral framework that facilitates the expansion of trade is likely to be one of the main challenges facing the world trading system in the coming years. This handbook offers an introduction to the complex world of modern PTAs. It follows in the steps of earlier, seminal World Bank publications on the economics and practice of PTAs, notably new dimensions in regional integration, trade blocs, and regional integration and development. Supplementing these earlier publications, this volume aims at taking its audience beyond the traditional market access paradigm to consider more broadly and systematically the numerous regulatory policy dimensions that are contained in modern PTAs. In particular, it offers a framework for understanding a number of behind-the-border policies typically covered in PTAs, including labor mobility, investment, trade facilitation, competition, and government procurement, as well as other societal and more normative policies related to intellectual property, environment, labor rights, and human rights. These latter are increasingly among the policies driven by powerful trading blocs as they strive to influence developing countries and the evolution of the global trading system. The handbook is also inspired by the numerous requests received by the World Bank from developing countries or groups of developing countries worldwide for advice on PTAs, including those currently being negotiated, as an aid in understanding the obligations and the possible economic and development implications of various provisions.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2329", "subjectTags": [""], "pubtype": [], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2329/634040PUB0Pref00Box0361517B0PUBLIC0.pdf.jpg?sequence=5", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2329/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2329", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:04:14Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2293": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2293/613110PUB0impr187000109780821387009.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2293/613110PUB0impr187000109780821387009.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Global Monitoring Report 2011 : Improving the Odds of Achieving the MDGs", "abstract": "This report has been prepared jointly by the staffs of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

The report lays out the challenges that remain; analyzes efforts to improve human development; and assesses the role of growth, policy reforms, trade, and donor policies in meeting the MDGs. The findings from this year's report offer reason for both hope and concern.

suggests that migration generates benefits for migrants, the host societies, and the countries of origin. The economic benefits for the countries of origin are realized primarily through the receipt of remittances. These large and stable resource flows remained relatively resilient during the global financial crisis compared to steep declines in private capital flows, and they have quickly recovered to the pre crisis levels. African countries are estimated to have received $40 billion in officially recorded flows in 2010, but the true size is believed to be far larger. Remittances are associated with reduction in poverty, improved education and health outcomes, and increased availability of funds for small business investments. Remittances represent a positive and relatively noncontroversial outcome of migration. This volume brings together studies of remittance markets in eight Sub-Saharan African countries and two key destinations for African migrants outside the African continent. It provides an overview of the remittance markets, and the policy and institutional environments in both sending and receiving countries. Based on primary surveys of remittance service providers about the types of remittance services, barriers to entry and exit, legal and regulatory environment, remittance costs, and innovative technologies, the chapters of this volume provide a unique window into the functioning of remittance markets in this region. the volume, measures to reduce remittance fees, increase market competition and consumer protection, increase the involvement of post offices and other non-bank institutions, and encourage the extension of mobile money transfer services to cross-border remittances will benefit the ultimate clients, the people of Africa. I hope that the findings of this volume will motivate more research, improved data collection, and policy action in the area of migrant remittances in Africa.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2292", "subjectTags": ["access of migrants", "access to remittances", "account transfers", "account-to-account", "agricultural development", "asylum", "automatic teller", "automatic teller machine", "average transfer", "balance of payments", "balance of payments statistics", "bank account", "bank accounts", "bank branch", "bank branches", "banking services", "border transactions", "border transfers", "business loans", "capita income", "capital flows", "child labor", "child mortality", "costs of remittances", "countries of origin", "country of origin", "country remittances", "credit constraints", "credit cooperatives", "credit products", "data on remittances", "debit cards", "deposits", "destination country", "developing countries", "development impact of remittances", "direct deposit", "dissemination", "domestic money", "domestic money transfer", "domestic remittance", "domestic remittances", "economic downturns", "economic growth", "economic policies", "educational attainment", "effects of remittances", "electronic funds", "electronic transfers", "emigrant remittances", "emigration", "exchange rate", "exchange rates", "financial flows", "financial infrastructure", "financial institution", "financial intermediaries", "financial intermediation", "financial services", "financial services industry", "food security", "foreign currency", "foreign direct investment", "foreign exchange", "future remittance", "future remittances", "future remittances as collateral", "global remittances", "gross domestic product", "health care", "health care services", "household surveys", "identification requirements", "immigrant", "immigrant population", "immigrants", "immigration", "immigration restrictions", "impact of remittances", "importance of remittances", "income", "incomes", "increase in remittances", "informal channels", "informal flows", "informal remittance", "informal transfers", "international efforts", "international migrants", "international money orders", "international money transfer", "international remittance", "international remittance recipients", "international remittances", "labor supply", "legal status", "leverage remittances", "liquidity", "living standards", "local capacity", "macroeconomic level", "macroeconomic shock", "market competition", "migrant", "migrant destination countries", "migrant remittance", "migrant workers", "migrants", "migration data", "money laundering", "money order", "money transfer", "money transfer companies", "money transfer instruments", "money transfer operator", "money transfer operators", "money transfer services", "money transfer system", "money transfers", "money transmitters", "money-transfer companies", "natural disasters", "nutrition", "official development assistance", "payment services", "point of sale", "points of service", "policy implications", "post offices", "postal networks", "postal service", "postal services", "practitioners", "recipient countries", "recipient country", "recipient households", "regulatory framework", "remittance", "remittance business", "remittance channels", "remittance corridors", "remittance costs", "remittance data", "remittance flows", "remittance industry", "remittance inflows", "remittance market", "remittance marketplace", "remittance outflows", "remittance products", "remittance providers", "remittance receipts", "remittance receivables", "remittance recipients", "remittance sender", "remittance senders", "remittance service", "remittance service providers", "remittance services", "remittance transfers", "remittance-receiving households", "remittances for development", "remittances for investment", "remittances remittances", "resource flows", "return migrants", "rural areas", "saving money", "savings accounts", "school attendance", "secure transfer", "send money", "send remittances", "service provider", "small countries", "small remittances", "spouses", "technological innovations", "terrorist", "tertiary education", "transfer channels", "transfer money", "transfer of remittances", "transfer service", "undocumented migration", "unemployment", "unemployment rates", "use of remittances", "uses of remittances", "volume of remittance flows"], "pubtype": ["Directions in Development ;

As such it makes a significant contribution to the global debate on climate change and human rights by offering a comprehensive analysis of the international legal dimensions of this intersection. The study helps advance an understanding of what is meant, in legal and policy terms, by the human rights impacts of climate change through examples of specific substantive rights. It gives a legal and theoretic perspective on the connection between human rights and climate change along three dimensions: first, human rights may affect the enjoyment of human rights. Second, measures to address human rights may impact the realization of rights and third, that human rights have potential relevance to policy and operational responses to climate change, and may promote resilience to climate change, including in developing countries in a way that may help sustainable development. This study effectively consolidates knowledge from the fields of international human rights law, international law governing climate change and international environmental law, building on the existing work of the United Nation (UN) office of the high commissioner on human rights, the UN human rights council and the international council on human rights policy. Although it maintains a legal focus, the study has benefited from the input of a host of international experts from other disciplines as well.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2291",

Since 1984, the World Bank has financed 87 Financial Management Information System (FMIS) projects in 51 countries, totaling over US $2.2 billion, of which US $938 million was for FMIS-related Information and Communication Technology (ICT) solutions. This study presents the World Bank's experience with these investment operations, including substantial ICT components, in order to share the achievements and challenges observed, and provide guidance for improving the performance of future projects. This study is dived into five chapters. The introduction covers the definitions used and methodology applied in reviewing projects. Chapter 2 provides descriptive characteristics of the sample data drawn from Bank databases and describes general patterns in duration, regional distribution, costs, and ICT solutions implemented, among other aspects. Chapter 3 analyzes the performance of the projects, differentiating between ratings of the Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs) and the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) reports, as well as the factors contributing to the success and failure of projects and individual components. A detailed analysis of country case studies from Mongolia, Turkey, Albania, Guatemala, and Pakistan are presented in chapter 4. In conclusion, chapter 5 synthesizes the main lessons learned and prerequisites necessary for an effective FMIS project. The findings of this study are based on a comprehensive database of 55 closed and 32 active Treasury and FMIS projects implemented between 1984 and 2010 (pipeline projects were also analyzed in some sections). The data presented here was gathered from individual project ICRs, Project Appraisal Documents (PADs), the IEG reports, and complemented with interviews with task team leaders and relevant public sector and informatics specialists.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2297", "subjectTags": ["access to information", "accountability", "accounting", "accounting standards", "accounts payable", "action plan", "actual cost", "application software", "automation", "backup", "basic", "bidding", "broadband", "broadband networks", "business processes", "buying power", "capabilities", "capacity building", "chart of accounts", "client countries", "client server", "coding", "collaboration", "commercial software", "communication network", "communication technologies", "communication technology", "communities", "competitive bidding", "competitiveness", "components", "connectivity", "consolidation", "copying", "copyright", "customs", "data analysis", "data centers", "data collection", "data storage", "debt", "decentralization", "decision making", "description", "development of information", "digital", "digital certificates", "digital signature", "e-government", "e-government systems", "e-mail", "electronic payment", "enabling environment", "engineering", "equipment", "external consultants", "financial management", "financial management systems", "financial operations", "financial systems", "financial transactions", "functionality", "general public", "government expenditure", "government policy", "hardware", "high-speed", "human resource", "human resource management", "human resources", "human resources management", "ict", "images", "implementation period", "implementation resources", "industry standards", "information exchange", "information flows", "information security", "information system", "information technology", "innovation", "institutional capacity", "institutional development", "interfaces", "internal controls", "interoperability", "intervention", "interventions", "inventory", "inventory management", "knowledge sharing", "learning", "legal basis", "legislative framework", "licenses", "management accounting", "management information systems", "material", "monitoring mechanisms", "networks", "next generation", "number of users", "open source software", "open-source software", "payment system", "payment systems", "peer review", "pem", "performance indicators", "political leadership", "present value", "private sector", "private sector development", "procurement", "procurement processes", "programs", "project management", "public access", "public administration", "publishing", "queries", "relational databases", "reliability", "result", "results", "scanning", "server", "servers", "sites", "social development", "software development", "software packages", "software solution", "software solutions", "subsidiary", "supervision", "system design", "system development", "system requirements", "targets", "technical aspects", "technical assistance", "technical infrastructure", "technical requirements", "technological advances", "technology architecture", "technology infrastructure", "telecommunications", "telecommunications infrastructure", "telephone", "transaction", "transaction processing", "transition economies", "usability", "user", "users", "verification", "web", "web portal", "web publishing", "web site"], "pubtype": ["A World Bank study"], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2297/616400PUB0Fina1351B0Extop0ID0187500.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2297/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2297", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:03:33Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2296": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2296/616390PUB0Acco1351B0Extop0ID0185050.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2296/616390PUB0Acco1351B0Extop0ID0185050.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Accountability through Public Opinion : From Inertia to Public Action", "abstract": "This book contains a compilation of contributions to a workshop in November 2007, \"Generating Genuine Demand with Social Accountability Mechanisms,\" held in Paris, France, as well as specially commissioned articles and case studies from experts from development practice and academia.This publication is divided into eight sections: foundations;

This book brings relevant experience from both developed and developing countries to bear on issues confronting today's governments in linking with their diaspora. The chapters present different approaches used by countries that have tried to maximize the possible gains from migration by engaging more comprehensively with different diaspora groups and individuals. Some African countries are pursuing policies to develop links with Africans abroad, either to encourage them to return or to use their skills, knowledge, or financial capital to foster African development. The book discusses concrete examples of diaspora initiatives that are being implemented in Africa. There are comprehensive reviews on how the diaspora can promote trade and investment linkages. Some developing countries are using dual citizenship to deepen ties with their diaspora. The book directly addresses the issues of remittances-linked financial instruments, investments by the diaspora, diaspora bonds, contributions of skilled and unskilled diaspora in transferring knowledge, analytical research on return migration, and concrete circular migration experiences. There is a need to have a better understanding of these initiatives and to see whether they can be scaled up or replicated in other countries worldwide.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2295",

"abstract": "This report's objective is to develop the evidence base for policy making in relation to poverty reduction. It produces a diagnosis of the broad nature of the poverty problem and its trends in India, focusing on both consumption poverty and human development outcomes. It also includes attention in greater depth to three pathways important to inclusive growth and poverty reduction harnessing the potential of urban growth to stimulate rural-based poverty reduction, rural diversification away from agriculture, and tackling social exclusion. This report shows that urban growth, which has increasingly outpaced growth in rural areas, has helped to reduce poverty for urban residents directly. In addition, evidence appears of a much stronger link from urban economic growth to rural poverty reduction. Stronger links with rural poverty are due to a more integrated economy. Urban areas are a demand hub for rural producers, as well as a source of employment for the rural labor force. They are aiding the transformation of the rural economy out of agriculture. In urban areas, it is small and medium-size towns, rather than large cities, that appear to demonstrate the strongest urban-rural growth links. Urban growth also stimulates rural-urban migration.

The first person may describe a fenced-in industrial estate in a developing country, populated by footloose multinational corporations (MNCs) enjoying tax breaks, with laborers in garment factories working in substandard conditions. In contrast, the second person may recount the 'miracle of Shenzhen,' a fishing village transformed into a cosmopolitan city of 14 million, with per capita gross domestic product (GDP) growing 100-fold, in the 30 years since it was designated as an SEZ. A third person may think about places like Dubai or Singapore, whose ports serve as the basis for wide range of trade- and logistics-oriented activities. In this book, the author use SEZ as a generic expression to describe the broad range of modern economic zones discussed in this book. But we are most concerned with two specific forms of those zones: (1) the export processing zones (EPZs) or free zones, which focus on manufacturing for export; and (2) the large-scale SEZs, which usually combine residential and multiuse commercial and industrial activity. The former represents a traditional model used widely throughout the developing world for almost four decades. The latter represents a more recent form of economic zone, originating in the 1980s in China and gaining in popularity in recent years. Although these models need not be mutually exclusive (many SEZs include EPZ industrial parks within them), they are sufficiently different in their objectives, investment requirements, and approach to require a distinction in this book.", "subjectTags": ["accounting", "administrative procedures", "agriculture", "arbitrage", "barrier", "benefit analysis", "business environment", "carbon", "carbon

Through the specific use of mobile money (m-money) services, for example, customers have accessed informational services, such as balance inquiries in their bank accounts, and transactional services, such as sending remittances to other people or paying for goods and services via their mobile phones. M-money has also been used by national governments to pay employee salaries and benefits. A key objective of this report is to discourage use of informal systems through the creation of a proportionate and not overly burdensome regulatory framework. Overly restrictive identification and verification processes in know-your-customer (KYC) policies, for example, may push users back to the informal financial system. The evolution of m-money in Africa and in non-African, low-income countries means that low-income and low-capacity countries are grappling with ways to ensure compliance with international Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) standards. Thus, this report also provides some indications of how the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standards can be applied to low-income clients within an m-money context.

There is increasing evidence that investments in the nutritional, cognitive, and socio-emotional development of young children have high payoffs. Researchers and development practitioners are building on this evidence to raise the topic's profile and bring it to the attention of decision makers. This volume is an important contribution to these efforts. It thoroughly and carefully reviews the most recent empirical literature linking early childhood development outcomes, poverty, and shocks. In doing so, it brings an added perspective to the debate and makes the case that investments in the first years of life have the potential to be a critical component of poverty reduction strategies. The volume also goes beyond simply documenting the consequences of insufficient or inadequate focus on early childhood and identifies the range of policy options available to policy makers. The Human Development Perspectives series seeks to present thorough research findings on issues of critical strategic importance for developing countries. At its core is the perspective that investments in human capital are an essential aspect of efforts to promote global development and eradicate poverty. This volume makes it convincingly clear that investing in and protecting the human capital of young children is no small matter.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2266", "subjectTags": ["achievement", "addiction", "age groups", "aged", "anxiety", "attention", "basic education", "brain development", "care centers", "caregivers", "child health", "child mortality", "clinics", "cognition", "cognitive development", "cognitive outcomes", "cognitive skills", "community health", "day care", "day care centers", "demand for education", "depression", "developmental potential", "donor support", "dropouts", "early child development", "early childhood", "early childhood development", "early childhood education", "early childhood interventions", "early intervention", "early interventions", "early stimulation", "ecd", "ecd policies", "ecd programs", "education programs", "educational outcomes", "enrollment", "enrollment rates", "environmental factors", "families", "gender", "gross enrollment", "gross enrollment rates", "health services", "home visits", "human development", "individual counseling", "infant mortality", "intelligence", "intervention", "interventions", "language development", "language stimulation", "learning", "learning materials", "legal status", "life cycle", "low birth weight", "malnutrition", "memory", "mental", "mental development", "migration", "morbidity", "mortality", "nutrition", "nutritional status", "orphans", "parenting", "personality", "physical growth", "pollution", "preprimary school enrollment", "preschool education", "preschool enrollment", "preschool programs", "preschools", "primary education", "primary school", "primary school education", "primary schools", "psychology", "public health", "readers", "reading", "recognition", "risk factors", "rural areas", "school readiness", "schooling", "siblings", "smoking", "social behavior", "speech", "storytelling", "universal primary education", "violence", "wages", "workers", "working memory", "young children", "youth"], "pubtype": ["Human Development Perspectives"], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2266/600410PUB0ID181Matter09780821386774.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2266/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2266", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:02:45Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2267": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2267/600390PUB0ID171Health09780821379073.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2267/600390PUB0ID171Health09780821379073.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Rethinking School Health : A Key Component of Education for All", "abstract": "Education is one of the most important drivers of the development of individuals and societies. It not only has powerful implications for the creation of human capacity, but also helps people realize their full potential and expand their connections with the world. Economic analyses repeatedly demonstrate that education gives a high economic return within the life - span of an individual and is a key factor underlying the economic growth of nations. Viewed from these perspectives, the decision at the turn of the millennium of governments and development partners to pursue the goal of Education for All (EFA) was not only an important contribution to one sector, but the launch of an endeavor with major implications for the future of humanity. The early perception of the goal of EFA was that all children should have access to education-every child should be able to exercise the right to go to school. This limited goal soon broadened to address the quality of the education that a child received at school and the factors that ensured the child was able to stay in school long enough to learn enough. These additional objectives have expanded the goal of EFA, so that it now aims to ensure that every child has the opportunity to complete an education of good quality, although definitions of quality and completeness remain under discussion. The question now is not whether school health and school feeding programs are necessary to EFA, but how they can be implemented at meaningful scale in the poorest countries, which need them the most.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2267", "subjectTags": ["academic achievement", "access to education", "adequate classrooms", "adolescents", "adults", "age groups", "aids epidemic", "anemia", "ari", "barriers to education", "basic learning", "basic learning needs", "chemotherapy", "child development", "child development programs", "child nutrition", "children with disabilities", "classroom", "classrooms", "clinics", "cognitive development", "cognitive function", "comparative education", "comprehensive school health", "conditional cash transfers", "crime", "demand for education", "dentistry", "diabetes", "diarrhea", "diet", "disabilities", "dropout rates", "early child development", "early childhood", "early childhood interventions", "eating habits", "education development", "education for all", "education for children", "education goals", "education management", "education outcomes", "education policies", "education programs", "education sector", "education strategy", "education system", "education systems", "educational access", "educational achievement", "educational attainment", "educational benefits", "educational outcomes", "educational planning", "educational quality", "effective education", "effectiveness of education", "elementary school", "enrollment", "epidemics", "equal opportunities", "family health", "family life", "family life education", "fee abolition", "folic acid", "friendly school", "friendly schools", "gender equality", "gender equity", "gender imbalances", "gender issues", "gender sensitive", "girls", "girls in education", "global education", "global initiative on education", "health education", "health interventions", "health messages", "health policy", "health providers", "health services", "health-promoting schools", "hiv/aids", "human development", "hygiene", "imbalances in education", "immunodeficiency", "infection", "infectious diseases", "intervention", "iron", "iron supplements", "knowledge sharing", "learning", "learning achievement", "learning institution", "learning materials", "learning outcomes", "life skills", "life skills education", "life-skills", "malaria", "malnutrition", "maternal and child health", "mch", "medical research", "mental health", "mental health promotion", "morbidity", "mortality", "national education", "national school", "nongovernmental organizations", "number of students", "nurses", "nutrition", "nutrition interventions", "nutrition outcomes", "nutrition program", "nutrition programs", "obesity", "oral health", "orphans", "out-of-school children", "parent-teacher association", "parity", "participation in education", "participation of parents", "pediatrics", "performance at school", "physical activity", "physical education", "poor children", "primary completion", "primary completion rate", "primary school", "primary school completion", "primary school completion rate", "primary school-age children", "primary schools", "productivity", "public health", "pupil-teacher ratio", "quality education", "quality learning", "quality schools", "repeaters", "reproductive health", "reproductive health education", "returns to education", "risk factors", "risk groups", "safe drinking water", "sanitation", "school age", "school attendance", "school children", "school curricula", "school dropout", "school environment", "school fee", "school feeding", "school feeding programs", "school fees", "school health", "school health activities", "school health education", "school health interventions", "school health programs", "school health promotion", "school health services", "school hygiene", "school meal", "school meals", "school participation", "school performance", "school program", "school system", "school-age", "school-age child", "school-age children", "schoolchildren", "schooling", "screening", "sexual abuse", "sexual health", "sexuality", "sexuality education", "sexually transmitted diseases", "skills development", "social support", "state schools", "student performance", "stunting", "teacher", "teachers", "teaching", "textbooks", "tobacco", "tobacco use", "universal basic education", "universal education", "universal primary education", "unwanted pregnancy", "violence", "vulnerable children", "workers", "young people", "youth"], "pubtype": ["Directions in Development ;

Chapter two presents a host of strategic considerations for developing and managing an asset recovery case, including gathering initial sources of facts and information, assembling a team, and establishing a relationship with foreign counterparts for international cooperation. Chapter three introduces the techniques that practitioners may use to trace assets and analyze financial data, as well as to secure reliable and admissible evidence for asset confiscation cases. The provisional measures and planning necessary to secure the assets prior to confiscation are discussed in chapter four; and chapter five introduces some of the management issues that practitioners will need to consider during this phase. Confiscation systems are the focus of chapter six, including a review of the different systems and how they operate and the procedural enhancements that are available in some jurisdictions. On the issue of international cooperation, chapter seven reviews the various methods available, including informal assistance and mutual legal assistance requests; and guides practitioners through the entire process. Finally, chapters eight and nine discuss two additional avenues for asset recovery-respectively, civil proceedings and domestic confiscation proceedings undertaken in foreign jurisdictions.", "uri":

It is largely based on the fourth round of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD)-World Bank Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Surveys (BEEPS) covering over 11,000 firms in 29 countries in Europe and Central Asia (ECA). The report provides an update of the progress that ECA countries have made since 2005, extends (in certain respects) the analysis of corruption and regulatory burden on firms provided in the earlier Anticorruption in Transition (ACT) reports covering the period from 1999 to 2005, and in several instances provides comparisons of ECA countries to similar countries outside of the region using the World Bank enterprise surveys and other sources of data. Despite making significant progress on administrative bribery overall, corruption is cited more frequently by firms in the region as an obstacle to doing business than any other problem, with the exception of tax rates. In part, this continued perception of corruption as one of the most serious problems for business may reflect slower progress on other aspects of corruption not measured directly in firm-state interactions covered by the BEEPS.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2265", "subjectTags": ["access to financing", "accountability", "administrative costs", "administrative procedures", "advertising", "anti-corruption", "anticorruption", "bribe", "bribery", "bribes", "business climate", "business environment", "business indicator", "business indicators", "business interactions", "business regulation", "business services", "businesses", "capacity building", "certificates", "chapter 7", "complaints", "convictions", "copyright", "corrupt", "corrupt practices", "corruption", "corruption laws", "court decisions", "court performance", "court system", "credibility", "crime", "customs", "democracies", "e-mail", "electricity", "enforcement of laws", "enterprise survey", "enterprise surveys", "fair competition", "foreign ownership", "foreign trade", "global competitiveness", "government contract", "government contracts", "government officials", "government policies", "government regulation", "government regulations", "graft", "grand corruption", "illegal payments", "image", "information technology", "initiative", "inspection", "inspections", "integrity", "international standards", "international trade", "judgment", "judicial decisions", "judicial institutions", "judicial system", "judicial systems", "judiciary", "kickback", "kickbacks", "lan", "large firms", "legal frameworks", "license", "licenses", "manufacturing", "manufacturing industry", "market access", "market economies", "material", "media", "mentoring", "nepotism", "operating environment", "patronage", "perception of corruption", "politicians", "private sector", "privatization", "procurement", "procurement law", "procurement laws", "procurement procedures", "property rights", "public administration", "public funds", "public information", "public officials", "public procurement law", "public procurement laws", "public utilities", "queries", "regulatory framework", "regulatory regime", "regulatory systems", "result", "results", "supervision", "telephone", "telephone connection", "transition economies", "transparency", "users", "uses", "world trade"], "pubtype": ["World Bank Study"], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2265/594650PUB0ID1810Box358282B01PUBLIC1.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2265/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2265", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:02:43Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2262": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2262/594610PUB0ID1710Box358282B01PUBLIC1.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2262/594610PUB0ID1710Box358282B01PUBLIC1.txt?sequence=2", "title": "How to Engage with the Private Sector in Public-Private Partnerships in Emerging Markets", "abstract": "What transforms a desirable project on a government wish list to an attractive investment opportunity in the eyes of a potential private sector partner?

Data from the World Bank and the Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) private participation in infrastructure (PPI) project database indicate that private sector investment in infrastructure in developing economies grew steadily over the past decade. By 2007 the levels had finally surpassed the peak levels seen in 1997, the end of the previous growth spurt. This guide focuses specifically on what should be done, and when, in order to prepare projects to attract the right long-term private partners, procure their involvement, and manage the partnership.

And, given commodity price volatility, growing human and environmental pressures, and worries about food security, this interest will increase, especially in the developing world. One of the highest development priorities in the world must be to improve smallholder agricultural productivity, especially in Africa. Smallholder productivity is essential for reducing poverty and hunger, and more and better investment in agricultural technology, infrastructure, and market access for poor farmers is urgently needed. When done right, larger-scale farming systems can also have a place as one of many tools to promote sustainable agricultural and rural development, and can directly support smallholder productivity, for example, throughout grower programs. However, recent press and other reports about actual or proposed large farmland acquisition by big investors have raised serious concerns about the danger of neglecting local rights and other problems. They have also raised questions about the extent to which such transactions can provide long-term benefits to local populations and contribute to poverty reduction and sustainable development. Although these reports are worrying, the lack of reliable information has made it difficult to understand what has been actually happening. Against this backdrop, the World Bank, under the leadership of Managing Director Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, along with other development partners, has highlighted the need for good empirical evidence to

Greater effort will be needed to connect sectoral interventions and achieve synergies from public and private sector interventions; to build capacity and knowledge exchange; to take stock of experience in rain-fed agriculture; to ensure attention to financial sustainability and to cross-cutting issues of gender, environmental, and social impacts and climate; and to better integrate the World Bank Group support at the global and regional levels with that at the country level. This evaluation uses the typology of economies developed by the Agriculture for Development: World Development Report 2008 as one classification in its analysis. In the agriculture-based category, which includes most of Sub-Saharan Africa, development of the agriculture sector is essential to growth and poverty reduction, yet productivity is low, constrained by limited access to modern inputs, irrigation, communication, and transport. The World Bank Group support focused on alleviating these constraints is important to help achieve poverty reduction.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2279", "subjectTags": ["access to credit", "access to markets", "accountability", "advisory service", "advisory services", "advisory work", "agribusiness", "agricultural activities", "agricultural credit", "agricultural development", "agricultural economics", "agricultural growth", "agricultural industries", "agricultural innovation", "agricultural investments", "agricultural knowledge", "agricultural land", "agricultural lands", "agricultural marketing", "agricultural policy", "agricultural product", "agricultural production", "agricultural productivity", "agricultural products", "agricultural research management", "agricultural sector", "agricultural sectors", "agricultural systems", "agricultural technology", "agricultural yields", "agriculture", "agriculture organization", "agriculture policy", "agriculture projects", "agrochemicals", "animal diseases", "animal production", "animal products", "animal protein", "approval process", "arable land", "bank financing", "bank management", "banks", "biodiversity", "borrowing", "borrowing costs", "capacity building", "certification systems", "cgiar", "cgiar centers", "cgiar research", "cgiar secretariat", "client countries", "climate change", "coffee", "commercial lenders", "consultative group on international agricultural research", "cooperatives", "cotton", "credit availability", "crop", "crop production", "crop varieties", "crop yields", "cropping", "dairy products", "decentralization", "demand for food", "development assistance", "development projects", "discrimination", "drainage", "economic development", "economic growth", "economics", "employment", "empowerment", "entrepreneurs", "environmental sustainability", "exchange rate", "expenditure", "extension", "extension services", "extreme poverty", "fao", "farmers", "farming", "farmland", "farms", "fertilizers", "financial agencies", "financial crises", "financial institutions", "financial intermediaries", "financial sustainability", "fisheries", "food commodities", "food crops", "food demand", "food policies", "food prices", "food production", "food safety", "food security", "food shortages", "food supply", "foreign direct investment", "foreign investment", "forestry", "gender", "gender equality", "gender issues", "gender mainstreaming", "government funding", "grain", "green revolution", "group lending", "guarantee agency", "household food security", "icrisat", "ifad", "ifpri", "iita", "incomes", "insurance", "integration", "international bank", "international finance", "international food policy research institute", "irrigation", "lack of access", "lamb", "land administration", "land rights", "legislation", "limited access", "livelihoods", "livestock", "livestock feed", "mainstreaming gender", "market development", "meat", "natural resources", "new technologies", "palm oil", "pesticides", "policy environment", "population growth", "poverty reduction", "private equity", "private investments", "private sector", "productivity", "public investments", "public-private partnerships", "purchasing power", "r&d", "reorganization", "rice", "risk management", "rural access", "rural credit", "rural development", "rural finance", "rural infrastructure", "rural roads", "smallholder", "smallholder access", "smallholder participation", "social development", "soil management", "subsidiary", "sugarcane", "supply chain", "supply chains", "sustainable financing", "technical assistance", "the consultative group", "traceability", "transition economies", "transport", "union", "united nations", "urbanization", "usaid", "vegetables", "water use", "water use efficiency", "wheat", "wood", "world bank lending"], "pubtype": [], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2279/581080PUB0REPL10Box353788B01PUBLIC1.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2279/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2279", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:03:06Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2278": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2278/608050PUB0Asse10Box358332B01PUBLIC1.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2278/608050PUB0Asse10Box358332B01PUBLIC1.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Assessment of the Impacts of Climate Change on Mountain Hydrology : Development of a Methodology through a Case Study in the Andes of Peru", "abstract": "The objective of study of the impacts of climate change on mountain hydrology is to develop a methodology to assess the net impacts of climate change on the hydrological response in mountainous regions. This is done through a case study in the Peruvian Andes. There are few examples of predictions of the impact of climate change on resource availability and even fewer examples of the applications of such predictions to planning for sustainable economic development. This report presents a summary of the efforts of a Bank energy and climate change team to develop methodological tools for the assessment of climate impacts on surface hydrology in the Peruvian Andes. The importance of analyzing the potential climate impacts on hydrology in Peru arises in part from concerns about the retreat of tropical glaciers, the drying of unique Andean wetland ecosystems, as well as increased weather variability and weather extremes, all of which will affect water regulation. The study, together with a recently published report by the World Bank, Peru Overcoming the Barriers to Hydropower, is intended to inform plans for energy development in Peru and enable provides some insights into how hydrology may behave under future climate scenarios in Peru, the main purpose is to contribute to the methodological approaches to anticipate impacts from climate change in the Andes

The study analyses the impact and implication of the crisis on PPP infrastructure projects across the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) region. In the research undertaken for this study, it appears that most crisis-specific issues are cross-sectoral, therefore requiring cross-sectoral responses. The intended audience for this report includes national government stakeholders involved in infrastructure financing, including Ministries in charge of infrastructure, especially transport, energy, and water; state-owned enterprises with operational responsibilities, such as road directorates; and Ministries of Finance and development banks involved in PPP. This report reviewed the region's experience in PPPs in infrastructure before and during the financial crisis period (from late 2006 to 2010). Since not all ECA countries have had successful or ongoing PPP projects during this time, the report draws on lessons from Brazil, India, Spain, and the United Kingdom, countries with established PPP project pipelines to draw on cross-sectoral lessons. The findings can be used by countries wishing to start or re-start their PPP program following the impact of the recent crisis. However, beyond the crisis and its effects, the report can also guide future development of sustainable and crisis-resilient PPP programs. Most of the analysis supporting the report recommendations was undertaken for the highway sector and was financed through from a grant from the transport research support program. Initially, the highway sector was the focus of this study but the scope was later widened to include all infrastructure sectors because most issues facing highway PPP projects are common to other sectors requiring a cross-sectoral approach to PPP. Sector-specific strategies for highways have been documented in a recent World Bank study.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2274", "subjectTags": ["accountability", "accounting", "adb",

1", "abstract": "The global economic crisis that began in 2008 threatened to erase years of progress in developing countries. In response, the World Bank Group increased lending to unprecedented levels. The World Bank posted a large increase in middle income countries (MICs), and a much smaller one in low income countries (LICs). The International Finance Corporation (IFC) focused on trade finance, mainly in LICs. Its new business initially fell in MICs, rebounding only in late fiscal 2010. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) concentrated on guarantees in Eastern Europe. Analytic and advisory work helped inform government and private sector responses to the crisis. This report presents an initial real-time evaluation of the readiness, relevance, quality-at-entry, short-term results, and likely sustainability of the Bank Group response from the start of the crisis through fiscal 2010. This evaluation builds on a 2008 Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) assessment of Bank Group interventions during past crises and draws extensively on 11 country case studies and field visits.

It focuses on energy sector adaptation, rather than mitigation, which has been a key focus of the energy sector and is not discussed in this report. This report draws on available scientific and peer-reviewed literature in the public domain and takes the perspective of the developing world to the extent possible. It starts with a discussion about observed and projected climate change (out to 2100), exploring trends, extremes, and 'hotspots'- geographic regions that will see significant changes or variability for relevant parameters (for example, temperature, runoff , and sea level rise). It then discusses what is known about the impacts of these changes on energy resources, infrastructure, and transportation systems as well as demand. It discusses what technologies or services are more vulnerable and identifies gaps in information or knowledge. The report concludes with a number of proposed near-term actions to foster dialogue, to further inform sector practitioners, to disaggregate climate impacts to regional and local settings, and to improve the knowledge base. Underpinning all actions is recognition of the need for a broad and participatory approach that extends beyond traditional planning horizons and boundaries.", "uri":

"abstract": "This volume is a systematic stock-taking of the evidence on school accountability reforms in developing countries. It provides a measured and insightful review and assessment of the results of a variety of approaches that developing countries are experimenting with in their quest for better schools. It is not the final word on the subject, but will hopefully contribute to better policy choices, grounded in the evidence currently available. This book is about the threats to education quality that cannot be explained by lack of resources. It focuses on publicly financed school systems and the phenomenon of service delivery failures: cases where programs and policies that increase the inputs to education fail to produce effective delivery of services where it counts-in schools and classrooms. It documents what authors know about the extent and costs of service delivery failures in public education in the developing world. And it further develops aspects of the conceptual model posited in the World development report 2004: that a root cause of low-quality and inequitable public services-not only in education-is the weak 'accountability' of providers to both their supervisors and their clients (World Bank 2003). The central focus of this book, however, is a new story. It is that developing countries are increasingly adopting innovative strategies to attack these issues.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2270", "subjectTags": ["academic achievement", "access to

All the selected countries (Australia, Chile, Denmark, Sweden, and Switzerland) have mandatory or quasi-mandatory savings schemes. But they also exhibit significant differences in the structure of their pension systems, the relative importance of public pillars, the role and structure of private provision, the level of annuitization, and the structure and focus of their regulatory frameworks. Five studies have been commissioned to examine the state of annuity markets in each of these countries. The findings of these studies are summarized in the last five chapters of this book. The chapters of this book is discusses the various risks faced by pensioners and the risk characteristics of alternative retirement products, and it reviews the risks faced by providers of retirement products and the management and regulatory challenges of dealing with those risks. The chapter then discusses the risks faced by providers and reviews the challenges of various regulatory issues, ranging from the institutional organization of the market for retirement products to the regulation of marketing and pricing policies and the regulation of risk management.

One central aspect of the strategy is likely to be a stronger focus on inclusive growth. This will mean that higher priority will be placed on growing the local private sector, and broadening the base of the economy. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) in infrastructure and services can be a key instrument for achieving these goals especially in an economy like Liberia. The analysis contained in this study identifies the steps toward establishing PPPs as both a policy instrument and method for deepening private sector investment in Liberia. Liberia's rich natural resource endowments have played a fundamental role in the way in which the economy has developed, and in the way in which Government manages private investment in extractive industries. The Government itself has a long history of entering into concession contracts with private investors and operators. Firestone rubber first signed a concession agreement in 1926, and re-signed their concession to last until 2041. More recently, the Government of Liberia has entered into several large natural resource and mining concession contracts that will see large sums of private sector capital invested onshore. This study is one element of a multi-faceted effort to support local private sector and financial sector development in Liberia. It takes into close account the Government's focus on job-creation, the post-conflict dynamics in the country, and Liberia's reliance on extractive industries as a primary source of revenue. The analysis also builds on previous economic sector work that has looked closely at how to stimulate private sector growth and investment, how to support small and medium-size enterprise (SME), and how to leverage existing private sector investment to generate deeper local markets and create new jobs.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2244", "subjectTags": ["airports", "best practices",

Investment and Create Jobs", "abstract": "The World Bank's strategy for Africa's future recognizes the central importance of industrialization in Sub-Saharan Africa, and the consequent creation of productive jobs for Africans, which have long been a preoccupation of African leaders and policy makers. This book represents an attempt to address these issues. The book stresses that, while the recent turnaround in Africa's economic growth is encouraging, this growth must be accompanied by structural transformation to be sustainable and to create productive employment for its people. For many African countries, this transformation involves lifting workers from low-productivity agriculture and informal sectors into higher productivity activities. Light manufacturing can offer a viable solution for Sub-Saharan Africa, given its potential competitiveness that is based on low wage costs and abundance of natural resources that supply raw materials needed for industries. This study has five features that distinguish it from previous studies. First, the detailed studies on light manufacturing at the subsector and product levels in five countries provide in-depth cost comparisons between Asia and Africa. Second, building on a growing body of work, the report uses a wide array of quantitative and qualitative techniques, including quantitative surveys and value chain analysis, to identify key constraints to enterprises and to evaluate differences in firm performance across countries. Third, the findings that firm constraints vary by country, sector, and firm size led us to adopt a targeted approach to identifying constraints and combining market-based measures and selected government interventions to remove them. Fourth, the solution to light manufacturing problems cuts across many sectors and does not lie only in manufacturing alone. Solving the problem of manufacturing inputs requires solving specific issues in agriculture, education, and infrastructure. Fifth, the report draws on experiences and solutions from other developing countries to inform its recommendations. The report's goal is to find practical ways to increase employment and spur job creation in Sub-Saharan Africa.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2245", "subjectTags": ["accountability", "agriculture", "analytical approach", "arable land", "automobiles", "bank loans", "banks", "bargaining", "bargaining power", "benchmark", "benchmarking", "benchmarks", "benefit analysis", "borrowing", "business environment", "business environments", "business regulations", "business strategy", "capital requirements", "carbon", "certificate", "chamber of commerce", "climatic conditions", "commodities", "commodity", "comparative advantage", "competitiveness", "connectivity", "copyright", "cost of living", "country comparisons", "customs", "debt", "demonstration effects", "deposits", "development economics", "e-mail", "economic activity", "economic conditions", "economic development", "economic growth", "economic performance", "economic structure", "economies of scale", "employment opportunities", "enterprise survey", "enterprise surveys", "entrepreneurial skills", "environments", "equipment", "exploitation", "export growth", "export market", "export markets", "export opportunities", "exports", "financial institutions", "financial support", "fiscal policies", "fishing", "fixed prices", "foreign direct investment", "foreign exchange", "foreign investments", "future studies", "gdp", "gdp per capita", "global economy", "global market", "global markets", "government intervention", "government policy", "gross domestic product", "housing", "human resource", "import tariffs", "income", "industrial base", "industrial development", "industrial economy", "industrial structure", "industrialization", "inexperienced workers", "inflation", "information technology", "innovation", "input prices", "inspection", "institution", "insurance", "job creation", "labor costs", "labor disputes", "labor efficiency", "labor force", "labor legislation", "labor productivity", "labor relations", "land prices", "land use", "laws", "legislation", "licenses", "limited access", "local government", "local governments", "logging", "macroeconomic stability", "managerial skills", "manufacturing", "manufacturing industries", "market information", "market liberalization", "market share", "marketing", "material", "medium enterprises", "metals", "migration", "monopolies", "natural resources", "new entrants", "occupations", "oil", "one-stop shops", "open economies", "outputs", "payouts", "pdf", "penalties", "pension plans", "per capita income", "photo", "physical infrastructure", "policy makers", "political economy", "price controls", "private investment", "private partnerships", "private sector", "private sector development", "private sector investments", "producers", "production costs", "productivity", "productivity growth", "proven reserves", "purchasing power", "quality management", "queries", "rent seeking", "result", "results", "retail trade", "safety", "safety net", "safety nets", "savings", "search", "skilled labor", "skilled workers", "social development", "structural change", "subsidiary", "supervision", "suppliers", "supply chain", "sustainable growth", "tax revenue", "tax revenues", "technical assistance", "technical skills", "technical support", "technical training", "telecommunications", "telephone", "timber", "time frame", "trade liberalization", "training costs", "transaction", "transaction costs", "transport", "unemployment", "unskilled workers", "uses", "value added", "value chain", "value chains", "wage rates", "wages", "wan", "web", "willingness to pay"], "pubtype": ["Africa Development Forum"], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2245/9782744076626.pdf.jpg?sequence=13", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2245/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2245", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T08:44:25Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2246": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2246/672080PUB0EPI0020Box367844B09953137.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2246/672080PUB0EPI0020Box367844B09953137.txt?sequence=2", "title": "The Cash Dividend : The Rise of Cash Transfer Programs in Sub-Saharan Africa", "abstract": "The results of the review do not disappoint. The authors identified more than 120 cash transfer programs that were implemented between 2000 and mid-2009 in Sub-Saharan Africa. These programs have varying objectives, targeting, scale, conditions, technologies, and more. A sizable number of these programs conducted robust impact evaluations that provide important information, presented here, on the merits of cash transfer programs and their specific design features in the African context. The authors present summary information on programs, often in useful graphs, and provide detailed reference material in the appendixes. They highlight how many of the cash transfer programs in Africa that had not yet begun implementation at the time of writing will continue to provide important evaluation results that will guide the design of cash transfer programs in the region. In addition to presenting data and analysis on the mechanics of the programs, the authors discuss issues related to political economy. They highlight the importance of addressing key tradeoffs in cash transfers, political will, and buy-in, and they emphasize the need to build evidence-based debates on cash transfer programs. Useful anecdotes and discussion illustrate how some programs have dealt with these issues with varying degrees of success. This text will serve as a useful reference for years to come for those interested in large- and small-scale issues of cash transfer implementation, both in Africa and beyond. However, the book is not an end in itself. It also raises important questions that must be addressed and knowledge gaps that must be filled.

The sourcebook is also an important resource for the research community and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and may be a useful reference for the private sector, farmer organizations, and individuals with an interest in agricultural innovation. It concludes with details on the sourcebook's structure, a summary of the themes covered in each module, and a discussion of the cross-cutting themes treated throughout the sourcebook.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2247", "subjectTags": ["coordination", "collective action", "extension services", "advisory services", "innovation system", "networks", "brokering", "innovation capacity", "public-private partnerships", "research"], "pubtype": ["Agricultural and Rural Development"], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2247/672070PUB0EPI0067844B09780821386842.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2247/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2247", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T08:44:29Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2248": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2248/673620PUB0EPI007869B009780821389379.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2248/673620PUB0EPI007869B009780821389379.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Trade Competitiveness Diagnostic Toolkit", "abstract": "This Trade Competitiveness Diagnostic (TCD) toolkit provides a framework, guidelines, and practical tools needed to conduct an analysis of trade competitiveness.

Concerns about welfare of the rural elderly combine spatial and demographic issues. Large gaps exist between conditions in coastal and interior regions and between conditions in urban and rural areas of the country. In addition to differences in income by geography, considerable differences exist across demographic groups in the level of coverage by safety nets, in the benefits received through the social welfare system, and in the risks of falling into poverty. This book aims to do two things: first, it provides detailed empirical analysis of the welfare and living conditions of the rural elderly since the early 1990s in the context of large-scale rural-to-urban migration, and second, it explores the evolution of the rural pension system in China over the past two decades and raises a number of issues on its current implementation and future directions. Although the two sections of the book are distinct in analytical terms, they are closely linked in policy terms: the first section demonstrates in several ways a rationale for greater public intervention in the welfare of the rural elderly, and the second documents the response of policy to date and options to consider for deepening the coverage and effects of the rural pension system over the longer term.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2249", "subjectTags": ["absolute terms", "access to government", "age distribution", "aging populations", "basic benefit", "basic needs", "basic pension", "benefit level", "benefit levels", "center for population", "changes in fertility", "chronic poverty", "chronically poor", "consumption poverty", "consumption smoothing", "contribution records", "coresidence", "cultural change", "demographic change", "demographic projections", "demographic transition", "demographic trends", "dependency ratio", "dependency ratios", "determinant of poverty", "determinants of poverty", "developing countries", "dissemination", "economic growth", "economic transition", "elderly", "elderly households", "elderly men", "elderly people", "elderly persons", "elderly population", "elderly women", "employment opportunities", "employment status", "family income", "family members", "family planning", "family planning commission", "family size", "family support", "farm labor", "fertility", "fertility policies", "fertility rate", "fertility rates", "funded pensions", "future generations", "global population", "government pensions", "gross domestic product", "guaranteed rate", "health care", "health insurance", "higher incidence of poverty", "household consumption", "household head", "household income", "household incomes", "household poverty", "human capital", "human development", "ill health", "illness", "incidence of poverty", "income distribution", "income inequality", "income poverty", "income quintile", "income risk", "income shock", "income support", "individual account", "individual accounts", "inflation rate", "informal sector", "intergenerational transfers", "internal migration", "labor force participation", "labor income", "labor market", "labor markets", "labor supply", "legal status", "life expectancy", "living conditions", "local capacity", "local development", "local economy", "low fertility", "male labor force", "migrant", "migrant family", "migrant workers", "migrants", "migration", "mortality", "national fertility", "national level", "national pension", "national policy", "nutrition", "old age", "old age support", "old-age", "older people", "pension", "pension benefit", "pension benefits", "pension coverage", "pension income", "pension indicators", "pension policy", "pension policy reform", "pension programs", "pension scheme", "pension schemes", "pension system", "pension systems", "pensionable age", "pensions", "persistent poverty", "policy makers", "policy research", "policy research working paper", "policy response", "political economy", "poor", "poor areas", "poor people", "poor rural households", "poorer households", "population and development", "population census", "population center", "population growth", "population growth rate", "population projections", "population research", "population statistics", "population structure", "population trends", "poverty assessment", "poverty gap", "poverty head", "poverty incidence", "poverty index", "poverty level", "poverty line", "poverty measures", "poverty poverty", "poverty rate", "poverty rates", "poverty severity", "poverty status", "private transfers", "public policy", "public support", "reduction in poverty", "remittance", "remittances", "respect", "retirement", "retirement ages", "retirement decisions", "rural", "rural areas", "rural economy", "rural household", "rural incomes", "rural men", "rural migrants", "rural people", "rural poor", "rural population", "rural population growth", "rural populations", "rural poverty", "rural residents", "rural workers", "safety nets", "savings", "social affairs", "social assistance", "social insurance", "social pension", "social pensions", "social protection", "social protection mechanisms", "social sciences", "social security", "social security benefits", "social security system", "social services", "social support", "social welfare", "spatial differences", "spillover", "spouse", "state university", "support falls", "targeting", "united nations population division", "urban areas", "urban migration", "urban population", "urbanization", "village leaders", "vulnerability", "vulnerability to poverty", "working-age population", "world population", "young adult", "young adults", "young people"], "pubtype": ["Directions in Development ;

This report presents insights from this research based on case studies of six sectors: agriculture, health, energy, information and communication technology (ICT), transport, and logistics. Based on more than 80 interviews cutting across Uganda's small and medium-sized enterprises, universities, and government entities, the report's findings are intended to offer the government and its partners in industry increased clarity about how better to harness science, technology, and innovation to propel the economy. Enabling implementation of the recent Uganda national science, technology, and innovation policy is a parallel goal of the report. The policy articulates the government's intent to foster research and development that builds the human capital that Uganda requires for a knowledge-based economy. The case studies from which this report's recommendations are drawn depict a diverse range of experiences across industrial sectors in terms of generating, applying, and adapting science and technology to contribute to Uganda's development. Despite the relatively small size of the country's investments in science and technology, the past 20 years have seen considerable advances in building capacity in science and technology, developing related institutions and human resources, advancing collaboration and communication, and expanding the base of available knowledge. But given Uganda's limited investments in science and technology, policies should prioritize near-term investments that benefit key sectors. This report identifies those near-term investments as well as longer-term ones (three to five years in the future).", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2250", "subjectTags": ["access to technology",

"abstract": "Since 2003, Peru has emerged as an open, rapidly growing economy. Over the review period of 2003-09, successive governments adopted policy platforms aimed at maintaining macroeconomic stability, furthering the private sector supply response, broadening participation in growth, improving social service delivery, and strengthening public institutions. The World Bank Group (WBG) supported each of the three pillars of the government's poverty reduction strategy, namely: (i) broad-based economic growth that engaged a higher share of the population; (ii) enhanced human development through improved social service delivery; and (iii) strengthened public sector institutions. Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) recommends that the WBG: (i) tailor its strategy to support long-term integration of Peru's three distinct regions; (ii) seek opportunities to support large-scale infrastructure development; (iii) develop a more strategic approach to helping improve public sector management; (iv) seek further innovations in International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD's) instruments against a backdrop of declining demand for its financial resources; (v) seek to help develop a strategic planning function in Peru; (vi) build a close strategic partnership with development partners that provides concessional finance in the social sectors to optimize synergies with IBRD policy lending and analytic and advisory activities; (vii) develop a strategic focus for International Finance Corporation (IFC) around employment- generating industries in emerging sectors; (viii) maintain IFC's additionality by supporting lower-tier and more regionally dispersed private companies; and (ix) leverage the strong country presence of IBRD and IFC to enhance Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency's (MIGA's) marketing and risk assessment functions.", "uri":

how macroeconomic policies create differential opportunities for women and men. This volume comprises nine chapters covering four broad themes: gender as a category of analysis in macroeconomics; the implications of gender for macroeconomic aggregates, in particular consumption and economic growth; the role of gender in the labor market, globalization, and access to credit; and gender budgeting. Chapters one and two address the first theme. Chapter one focuses on the macroeconomic cost to growth and development that arises from rigid gender roles and associated gender asymmetries. Chapter two documents the progress made in gender mainstreaming by highlighting developments in data collection and monitoring that have moved beyond simply disaggregating data by male and female. Chapters three and four cover the second theme. Chapter three considers the role of gender relations in the macroeconomic aggregates of consumption, savings, investment, and government expenditure and the implications for macroeconomic policy in these areas. Chapter four examines gender relations and economic growth. Chapters five through seven focus on the third theme. Chapter five examines the labor market. Chapter six examines how globalization affects gender relations, particularly employment. Chapter seven concentrates on women's access to finance and documents gender asymmetries in this market. Chapter eight, on the fourth theme, highlights the impact fiscal policies have on gender relations. It documents how policy can be made more gender specific and reports on the progress made by countries that have adopted gender-responsive government budgeting. Chapter nine summarizes what is known about gender and macroeconomic policy, noting areas in which the literature is well developed as well as areas that require further research and study.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2256", "subjectTags": ["access to credit", "access to finance", "access to resources", "agricultural products", "allocation of resources", "bank loans", "biases", "biological differences", "births", "borrowing", "capital accounts", "child mortality", "child mortality rates", "civil society organizations", "credit association", "credit markets", "debt", "developing countries", "development policies", "disparities between girls", "disposable income", "dissemination", "domestic violence", "earnings", "economic activities", "economic contribution", "economic crises", "economic development", "economic empowerment", "economic growth", "economic opportunities", "economic policies", "economic policy", "economic resources", "economic role of women", "education level", "educational attainment", "educational opportunities", "effects of gender", "employer", "employers", "employment opportunity", "employment status", "empowerment of women", "enrollment", "entrepreneurs", "equal opportunities", "equal pay", "equality of opportunity", "expenditure", "expenditures", "families", "family income", "family welfare", "female genital mutilation", "female labor", "female labor force", "female labor force participation", "female literacy", "female population", "feminism", "feminist", "feminist economics", "feminists", "finance access", "financial market", "financial services", "fiscal policies", "formal education", "gender", "gender advisers", "gender analysis", "gender asymmetries", "gender awareness", "gender biases", "gender blind", "gender budgeting", "gender differences", "gender dimensions", "gender discrimination", "gender disparities", "gender disparity", "gender division of labor", "gender equality", "gender equality goals", "gender equality in rights", "gender equity", "gender gap", "gender gaps", "gender indicators", "gender inequalities", "gender inequality", "gender issues", "gender mainstreaming", "gender neutral", "gender norms", "gender parity", "gender relations", "gender roles", "gender sensitive", "gender specific", "gender statistics", "gender-related issues", "girls", "gross domestic product", "gross enrollment ratio", "gross national product", "household chores", "household dynamics", "household income", "household level", "households", "human capital", "human development", "human resources", "husbands", "ids", "illiteracy", "illness", "immunization", "implications for development", "income-generating activities", "individual choices", "informal sector", "information service", "integration of gender", "international bank", "international migrants", "labor force", "labor force participation", "labor market", "labor markets", "labour market", "labour organization", "lack of access", "land ownership", "legal abortions", "legal status", "levels of education", "life expectancy", "literacy rates", "live births", "low-income countries", "mainstreaming gender", "market economy", "married women", "maternal health", "microcredit", "millennium development goal", "mother", "nutrition", "older women", "opportunities for women", "parliamentary seats", "participation by women", "participation in decision", "persistent inequalities", "point of departure", "policy implications", "polygamy", "primary school", "primary school??age", "productivity", "progress", "public policy", "purchasing power", "purchasing power parity", "rape", "reproductive roles", "respect", "role of gender", "rural areas", "savings", "savings rate", "school attendance", "school year", "school-age population", "secondary education", "self-employment", "sex", "sex differences", "sex discrimination", "sex discrimination against women", "sex ratio", "sexes", "sexual division of labor", "sexuality", "small businesses", "small enterprise", "small enterprises", "social sciences", "sources of income", "status of women", "tertiary education", "undp", "unemployment", "unemployment rates", "unesco", "unifem", "united nations", "united nations development fund for women", "united nations development programme", "urban areas", "violence against women", "wage differentials", "wid", "woman", "women farmers", "women in development", "women in education", "work experience", "world health organization", "young children", "young women"], "pubtype": ["Directions in Development ;

This report shows how smart investments and policies in transport can connect poor places to the dynamic economies of their rich neighbors. There is also a wide open field of opportunity for telecommunications to bring electronic proximity to lagging areas. Many countries have spent huge sums on subsidies to entice investors to lagging areas-usually without any sustainable impact. This report recommends that governments turn their efforts toward the new approach to local economic development, which is gaining ground around the world, and is based on economic clusters, local competitive advantage, private initiative, and public-private dialogue. The report describes the state-of-play in territorial planning, public financial management, targeted programs, deconcentration, and decentralization, and it sketches some emerging lessons. This report combines the insights of specialists in the majority of the World Bank's key sectors: agriculture, development economics, education, health, poverty analysis, social protection, and transport. It is the report's modest aim, if not to offer a single formula for reducing spatial disparities, at least to propose a range of policy options that the region's leaders can reflect on in the light of their national objectives.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2255", "subjectTags": ["accounting", "accounting practices", "accounting standards", "advanced technology", "atm", "atm card", "bank branches", "basic", "business development", "central banks", "commercial banks", "commercialization", "communication technologies", "communication technology", "communities", "computerization", "credit cards", "credit products", "database management", "deficits", "deposit market", "depositors", "deposits", "digital", "digital divide", "e-government", "e-learning", "e-mail", "egovernment", "financial institution", "financial institutions", "financial performance", "financial service providers", "financial services", "financial transactions", "fixed asset", "income", "information services", "insurance", "international mail", "international remittance", "international remittances", "latin american", "learning", "legal framework", "letter carriers", "liquidity", "mail business", "mail carrier", "mail carriers", "mail flow", "mail flows", "mail handling", "mail items", "mail processing", "mail service", "mail services", "mail volume", "mail volumes", "management information systems", "marketing", "microfinance", "middle east", "migration", "money transfer", "money transfer products", "money transfer services", "money transfers", "money transmission", "national postal", "national postal operator", "national postal operators", "new technologies", "new technology", "north africa", "number of post offices", "outsourcing", "packages", "parcels", "payment services", "payment systems", "payments instruments", "pensions", "post", "post office", "post office savings", "post office savings banks", "post offices", "postal", "postal administrations", "postal agents", "postal bank", "postal banks", "postal checking", "postal counters", "postal employee", "postal financial services", "postal infrastructure", "postal mail", "postal management", "postal market", "postal markets", "postal network", "postal networks", "postal offices", "postal operations", "postal operator", "postal operators", "postal organizations", "postal policy", "postal reform", "postal revenues", "postal savings", "postal sector reform", "postal service", "postal services", "postal staff", "posts", "private operators", "privatization", "productivity", "profitability", "programs", "public agencies", "public postal sector", "public services", "quality of service", "remittance services", "remittances for development", "remittances ?? product", "remote post offices", "rural post offices", "savings accounts", "savings banks", "savings mobilization", "subsidiaries", "telecommunication", "telecommunication services", "telecommunications", "traditional mail", "transport", "universal postal", "universal postal union", "universal service", "universal service obligation", "upu", "volume of mail", "volumes of mail", "worldwide postal network"], "pubtype": ["MENA Development Report"], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2255/589970PUB0ID181UBLIC109780821383216.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2255/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2255", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:02:28Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2253": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2253/588480PUB0Conf101public10BOX353816B.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2253/588480PUB0Conf101public10BOX353816B.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Confronting Poverty in Iraq : Main Findings", "abstract": "This book provides the most comprehensive and rigorous analysis of Iraqi living standards to be carried out in several decades. It makes extensive use of the Iraq Household Socio-Economic Survey (IHSES), the first nationwide income and expenditure survey since 1988. IHSES data were complemented with a wide range of other sources, providing a holistic perspective on living standards that was previously unavailable. The analysis presented here was carried out with two main goals, first, to inform the Government's poverty reduction strategy; and second, to create a baseline against which future progress in poverty reduction can be monitored and assessed. Iraq is moving forward. The challenge requires re-development and recovery of what has been lost, including the stimulus provided by economic opportunity. A transition in policy is needed from provision of minimal food subsistence to long-term investments in human productivity. An environment more conducive to the poor can be created by investments that help citizens to benefit from their own labor and education. This challenge is being concretely addressed in the newly adopted national Poverty Reduction Strategy.

While precise definitions may vary, development is, at heart, a process of building wealth, the produced, natural, human, and institutional capital which is the source of income and wellbeing. A key finding is that it is intangible wealth, human and institutional capital, which dominates the wealth of all countries, rising as a share of the total as countries climb the development ladder. The book is divided into two parts. The first part provides the big picture of changes in wealth by income group and geographic region, with a focus on natural capital because it is especially important for low-income developing countries. The second part presents case studies that illustrate particular aspects of wealth accounting, including accounting for climate change, the role of intangible capital in growth and development, measuring human capital, and the use of wealth accounting to improve transparency and governance in resource-rich economies. The final chapter reports on the implementation of wealth accounting by countries.

This diagnostic note draws on a detailed analysis conducted by a PricewaterhouseCoopers India consulting team in 2008-09 for the World Bank. The data are based on information on about 180 wind, biomass, and small hydropower projects in 20 states, as well as information from and norms of the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) and the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC). The study is intended to provoke discussions of the feasibility of renewable energy development in India. Why is renewable energy development relevant? How much development is economically feasible? What needs to be done to realize the potential? Each of these topics is addressed in a separate chapter, all of which suggest a few implementable measures that India can consider to tap its economically feasible unharnessed potential.", "uri":

Both reports draw primarily on information from data collected prior to the crisis. This report also uses data on employment and access to finance collected during the crisis in a subset of ECA countries. The global financial crisis has had enormous consequences for firms' access to finance, the availability of qualified workers, and the ability of governments to provide (and of private sector to obtain) reliable infrastructure services. The extent and impact of these constraints is yet to be determined but their presence at a time of economic growth suggests they may re-emerge during the post-crisis economic recovery. The BEEPS captures information on a number of aspects of the business environment. This report highlights the elements of firm finance, labor regulations and skills, and infrastructure that are covered by the BEEPS questionnaire.

"Revenue administration is a major interface between the state and its citizens. A good revenue administration is, therefore, an important attribute of good government. As a result, in recent years, policy makers have become increasingly aware of the importance of policies that will promote business development while ensuring voluntary tax compliance. In the modern context, it is neither desirable nor feasible to examine or inspect every single taxpayer. The revenue administration, therefore, has to rely on effective management of compliance. Promoting voluntary compliance, achieved through a self-assessment system in which taxpayers comply with their tax obligations without intervention from tax officials, requires developing modern approaches to audits based on risk management. The impact of audits critically depends on a properly designed audit selection strategy focused on high-risk taxpayers to provide the most cost-effective outcome. This, in itself, contributes to promoting voluntary compliance. Risk-based country audits: approaches and country experiences are an important study of this critical revenue function of compliance management.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2314", "subjectTags": ["accounting", "accounting treatment", "administrative costs", "advance pricing", "alm", "asymmetric information", "auditors", "bank credit", "banks", "barrier", "business development", "business tax", "capital investment", "cash flows", "checks", "commodity", "conflicts of interest", "copyright clearance", "copyright clearance center", "corporate governance", "corporate income tax", "corporate tax", "corporate tax planning", "cost structure", "credit card", "credit risk", "credit scoring", "cross-border transactions", "customer information", "data flows", "debt", "debt collection", "deductions", "demographic", "developing countries", "econometrics", "employment", "exchange transactions", "excise tax", "expenditures", "exposure", "externalities", "finance corporation", "financial data", "financial structures", "financing arrangements", "fiscal reform", "foreign exchange", "foreign exchange transactions", "fraud", "global risk", "globalization", "good governance", "governance practices", "government policies", "government revenues", "gross profit", "gross revenue", "growth rates", "holding", "income", "income tax", "income taxes", "inflation", "information processing", "information sharing", "information system", "information technologies", "information technology", "input tax", "insurance", "insurance companies", "insurance company", "interest rates", "internal revenue", "international bank", "international development", "international economics", "international economy", "international finance", "international tax law", "inventory", "investment climate", "judgment", "legal framework", "legal obligations", "legislation", "level of risk", "market segmentation", "micro enterprises", "monetary fund", "operating costs", "opportunity cost", "opportunity costs", "output", "particular country", "peer review", "penalties", "profit margin", "property rights", "public funds", "public services", "real estate", "regulatory authorities", "risk management", "risk management system", "risk management systems", "risk profiles", "risk reduction", "sales tax", "shareholder", "shareholder protection", "shareholders", "small business", "small businesses", "small enterprises", "subsidiary", "tax", "tax administration", "tax assessment", "tax audit", "tax auditing", "tax audits", "tax avoidance", "tax base", "tax collections", "tax compliance", "tax consultants", "tax credit", "tax evasion", "tax law", "tax liabilities", "tax liability", "tax obligations", "tax payers", "tax policies", "tax policy", "tax rate", "tax receipts", "tax reform", "tax reforms", "tax regime", "tax return", "tax returns", "tax revenue", "tax rules", "tax savings", "tax structure", "tax system", "tax systems", "tax treatment", "taxation", "taxation power", "taxpayer", "taxpayer service", "taxpayer services", "taxpayers", "technical assistance", "trading", "transaction", "transfer pricing", "transition countries", "transition economies", "treasury", "turnover", "value added tax", "value added taxes", "warehouse", "warehouses"], "pubtype": [], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2314/627010PUB0Risk000public00BOX361489B.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2314/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2314", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:03:55Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2315": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2315/626990PUB0WDI0000public00BOX361489B.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2315/626990PUB0WDI0000public00BOX361489B.txt?sequence=2", "title": "World Development Indicators 2011", "abstract": "World development indicators 2011, the 15th edition in its current format, aims to provide relevant, high-quality, internationally comparable statistics about development and the quality of people's lives around the globe. Fifteen years ago, World development indicators was overhauled and redesigned, organizing the data to present an integrated view of development, with the goal of putting these data in the hands of policymakers, development specialists, students, and the public in a way that makes the data easy to use. Although there have been small changes, the format has stood the test of time, and this edition employs the same sections as the first one: world view, people, environment, economy, states and markets, and global links. This edition focuses on the impact of the decision to make data freely available under an open license and with better online tools. To help those who wish to use and reuse the data in these new ways, the section introductions discuss key issues in measuring the economic and social phenomena described in the tables and charts and introduce new sources of data. The choice of indicators and text content was shaped through close consultation with and substantial contributions from staff in the World Bank's four thematic networks sustainable development, human development, poverty reduction and economic management, and financial and private sector development and staff of the International Finance Corporation and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2315", "subjectTags": ["agricultural output", "agriculture", "air", "air pollution", "balance of payments", "base year", "benchmark", "cd", "child malnutrition", "child mortality", "childbirth", "debt", "deforestation", "development assistance", "development economics", "development indicators", "disease prevention", "economic activity", "economic growth", "economic performance", "emissions", "employment", "energy efficiency", "exchange rate", "exchange rates", "exports", "extreme poverty", "gambia", "gdp", "gdp per capita", "girls", "gnp", "government expenditures", "gross domestic product", "gross domestic product per capita", "gross national product", "housing", "imports", "income", "income groups", "intermediate inputs", "international organizations", "labor force", "land use", "live births", "low income", "malnutrition", "maternal health", "maternal mortality", "maternal mortality ratio", "mortality", "mortality rates", "mothers", "national income", "nutrition", "population dynamics", "population growth", "pregnancy", "price indexes", "private sector", "producers", "productivity", "purchasing power", "refugees", "reproductive health", "risk factors", "social indicators", "sub-saharan africa", "tariff barriers", "trade blocs", "underweight children", "unemployment", "urbanization", "uruguay", "uzbekistan", "valuation", "value added", "water pollution", "weight", "world health organization"], "pubtype": ["World Development Indicators"], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2315/626990CHINESE00icators020110Chinese.pdf.jpg?sequence=13", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2315/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2315", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:03:56Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2312": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2312/626960PUB0Citi000public00BOX361489B.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2312/626960PUB0Citi000public00BOX361489B.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Cities and Climate Change : Responding to an Urgent Agenda", "abstract": "The 5th urban research symposium on cities and climate change responding to an urgent agenda, held in Marseille in June 2009, sought to highlight how climate change and urbanization are converging to create one of the greatest challenges of our time. Cities consume much of the world's energy, and thus produce much of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. Yet cities, to varying extents, are also vulnerable to climate change impacts, with poor populations facing the greatest risk. Thus, adaptation and increased resilience constitute priorities for every city, and cities have a key role to play in mitigating climate change. Climate change mitigation and adaptation in cities has emerged as a new theme on the global agenda, creating a strong desire among governments, the private sector, and the academic community worldwide to learn from experiences and good practice examples. The 5th urban research symposium made an important contribution to the growing body of knowledge and practice in the area of cities and climate change. During the three-day symposium, approximately 200 papers were presented to more than 700 participants representing more than 70 countries. As co-organizers, the authors found it very rewarding to have such an audience and to see the wide range of topics discussed, from indicators and measurement to institutions and governance. This publication is comprised of an edited selection of the many papers submitted to the symposium and gives a flavor of the questions asked and possible answers. (The entire collection of symposium papers is available as an online resource for interested readers.) The authors look forward to the benefits that the knowledge gained and the partnerships forged during the symposium will have for global efforts on cities and climate change.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2312", "subjectTags": [""], "pubtype": ["Urban Development Series"], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2312/626960PUB0Citi000public00BOX361489B.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2312/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2312", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:03:54Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2313": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2313/626980PUB0Mult000public00BOX361489B.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2313/626980PUB0Mult000public00BOX361489B.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Global Development Horizons 2011 : Multipolarity - The New Global Economy", "abstract": "The world economy is in the midst of a transformative change. One of the most visible outcomes of this transformation is the rise of a number of dynamic emerging-market countries to the helm of the global economy. It is likely that, by 2025, emerging economies, such as Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, and the Russian Federation, will be major contributors to global growth, alongside the advanced economies. As they pursue growth opportunities abroad and encouraged by improved policies at home, corporations based in emerging markets are playing an increasingly prominent role in global business and cross border investment. The international monetary system is likely to cease being dominated by a single currency. Emerging-market countries, where three-fourths of official foreign exchange reserves are currently held and whose sovereign wealth funds and other pools of capital are increasingly important sources of international investment, will become key players in financial markets. In short, a new world order with a more diff use distribution of economic power is emerging, thus the shift toward multipolarity. The new report serves as a vehicle for stimulating new thinking and research on anticipated structural changes in the global economic landscape. To retain this forward looking orientation and to serve the World Bank Group's mandate of development and poverty alleviation, it is envisaged that future editions of Global Development Horizon (GDH) will be dedicated to themes of importance to the emerging development agenda and global economic governance, including changing global income inequality, increasing economic insecurity, global population aging, and the future shape of development finance.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2313", "subjectTags": ["emerging growth"], "pubtype": [], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2313/GDH2011_Chinese.pdf.jpg?sequence=13", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2313/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2313", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:03:54Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2311": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2311/626250PUB0Dam000id0182160BOX361487B.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2311/626250PUB0Dam000id0182160BOX361487B.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Opportunities in Dam Planning and Management : A Communication Practitioner's Handbook for Large Water Infrastructure", "abstract": "Communication for development is a comparatively new field that offers new tools and techniques to support inclusive and informed decisions in the planning and management of large water and energy infrastructure projects, including dams. Rethinking the approach to communication on dam projects is also timely in today's policy context. A window of opportunity has opened to tie in governance reform (including fighting corruption), poverty reduction, and communication with today's challenges in sustainable infrastructure development. Progress on any one of these aspects requires effective communication with stakeholders and interests. This handbook aims to help foster a 'communication culture' that will accommodate the wide range of stakeholder interests in dam planning and management in ways appropriate to the development context of today and the need to promote solutions to sustainability challenges. It seeks to create awareness among practitioners of the benefits and costs of improving the role of communication in infrastructure development. It also demonstrates how communication helps to improve governments' capacities to address corruption issues in infrastructure.
