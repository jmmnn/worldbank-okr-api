On the basis of their pragmatic value in guiding decisions, needs assessments are used in various professions and settings from emergency rooms to corporate boardrooms to guide decision making. Nonetheless, although needs assessments have many different applications, in this book on needs assessments as they are applied in organizations to accomplish results, as opposed to their use in personal decisions or medical triage. This book, in turn, is guide to assessing needs and then making essential decisions about what to do next. This book filled with practical strategies, tools, and guides covers both large-scale, formal needs assessments and less-formal assessments that guide daily decisions. Included in the book is a blend of rigorous methods and realistic tools that can help make informed and reasoned decisions. Together, these methods and tools offer a comprehensive, yet realistic, approach to identifying needs and selecting among alternative ways as go forward. Sections one and two offer quick, yet full, answers to many frequently asked questions regarding how to make justifiable decisions. Next, section three examines a variety of tools and techniques that can be used for both collecting information and making decisions. Appendix A then offers a number of checklists and guides for managing the systematic assessment processes that lead to quality decisions. Finally, the reference list at the end of the book is a valuable resource to research, tools, and discussions of needs assessment.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2231", "subjectTags": ["agricultural development", "agricultural laboratories", "agricultural practices", "agricultural production", "agricultural products", "agriculture", "analytical laboratories", "animal diseases", "animal health", "animal products", "aquaculture", "bank lending", "bombs", "capacity building", "cash management", "chemistry", "civil service status", "conflict of interest", "conflicts of interest", "contingency planning", "cost effectiveness", "crops", "cross contamination", "dairy", "dairy products", "decision making", "developing countries", "developing country", "development projects", "domestic market", "domestic markets", "dried fruit", "economic development", "economic risks", "egg", "emergency plans", "emergency response", "environmental health", "epidemiology", "equipment", "equipments", "expenditures", "export growth", "export performance", "exporter", "exporters", "extension", "extension services", "farmers", "farms", "fee income", "feed", "finances", "financial management", "financial sustainability", "fiscal autonomy", "fish", "fish processing", "fisheries", "fixed assets", "food control", "food handling", "food industries", "food industry", "food processing", "food production", "food products", "food regulations", "food safety", "food testing", "foreign market", "foreign markets", "fruit products", "funding mechanisms", "government funding", "government policies", "government regulations", "government support", "grapes", "groundnuts", "hazard", "hazards", "health care", "health management", "health regulations", "health services", "honey", "housing", "human capital", "human capital development", "human resources", "hygiene", "incomes", "infectious diseases", "international bank", "international cooperation", "international financial institution", "international financial institutions", "international organizations", "international standard", "international standards", "international support", "international trade", "investing", "investment alternatives", "investment climate", "investment decisions", "investment projects", "isolation", "issuance", "lab", "laboratories", "laboratory", "laboratory infrastructure", "labs", "lamb", "laws", "legal system", "level playing field", "livestock", "livestock products", "loan", "market access", "market country", "marketing", "meat", "ministries of agriculture", "national laboratory", "needs assessment", "nuts", "ownership structure", "parasites", "pathogens", "pesticide", "pesticides", "pests", "plant products", "political economy", "poor reputation", "poultry products", "private investment", "private investments", "private sector", "profit margin", "proteins", "public budget", "public budgeting", "public funds", "public health", "public investment", "public services", "quality control", "regulation of food", "regulatory constraints", "regulatory framework", "regulatory system", "reserve", "reserves", "return", "returns", "risk management", "rural development", "seafood", "soils", "spinach", "trading", "transition countries", "transition economies", "transparency", "trustees", "turnover", "universities", "veterinary services", "waste", "waste disposal", "world trade"], "pubtype": [], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2231/663920PUB0EPI00essing09780821388686.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2231/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2231", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T08:44:08Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2230": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2230/662320PUB0EPI00turing09780821389836.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2230/662320PUB0EPI00turing09780821389836.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Out-of-Court Debt Restructuring", "abstract": "This study provides a conceptual framework for the analysis of the questions of out-of-court debt restructuring from a policy-oriented perspective.

Actually, the study contemplates different restructuring techniques as forming a continuum to the treatment of financial difficulties. The study discusses the advantages and disadvantages of all the debt restructuring techniques, and concludes, in this regard, that a legal system may contain a number of options a menu that can cover different sets of circumstances. In the end, the law may offer a toolbox with very different instruments that the parties may use depending on the specific facts of the case.

Recession", "abstract": "This volume combines the analyses of leading experts on the various elements affecting economic growth and the policies required to spur that growth. Ascent after Decline: Regrowing Global Economies after the Great Recession identifies the main challenges to the economic recovery, such as rising debt levels, reduced trade prospects, and global imbalances, as well as the obstacles to growth posed by fiscal conundrums and lagging infrastructure. It also examines the way forward, beginning with the role of the state and then covering labor markets, information technology, and innovation. The common thread throughout the book is the view that economic re-growth will depend in large measure on smart policy choices and that the role of government has never been more crucial than at any time since the great depression. As members of the World Bank community, these issues are of particular importance to us, since without a resurrection of strong economic growth in major economies, the likelihood of rapid economic development in poorer developing countries is dampened. This is troubling because we have seen progress in many parts of the globe in the past decade, including in Africa, and these gains will be arrested as long as the global economy is in disarray. Donors will withdraw, investment will retrench, and prospects will dim. This immiserizing welfare outcome is to be avoided. The volume is intended to shed light on those areas of policy that reduce the prospects of a prolonged period of stress and decline by 'regrowing growth.'", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2233",

advantages determined by its given endowment structure at that time. The economy will be most competitive, the economic surplus will be the largest, and the capital accumulation and the upgrading of factor endowment structure will be the fastest possible. The 'New Structural Economics' presented in this book is an attempt to set out this third wave of development thinking. Taking into account the lessons learned from the growth successes and failures of the last decades, it advances a neoclassical approach to study the determinants and dynamics of economic structure. It postulates that the economic structure of an economy is endogenous to its factor endowment structure and that sustained economic development is driven by changes in factor endowments and continuous technological innovation. The paper also discusses binding constraints to growth in each of these industries' value chains as well as mechanisms through which governance-related issues in the implementation of industrial policy could be addressed.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2232", "subjectTags": ["growth"], "pubtype": [], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2232/663930PUB0EPI00nomics09780821389553.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2232/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2232", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T08:44:09Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2226": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2226/662180PUB0EPI00pia0health0workforse.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2226/662180PUB0EPI00pia0health0workforse.txt?sequence=2", "title": "The Health Workforce in Ethiopia : Addressing the Remaining Challenges", "abstract": "Health indicators in Ethiopia, particularly on child health and malaria, have improved significantly in recent years, with the next challenge now focused on improving maternal health indicators. Improvements in child health and malaria in particular can be attributed to strong government commitment towards health results, reflected in a number of notable policies and programs related to Human Resources for Health (HRH), in particular the health extension worker program. However, indicators related to maternal health remain problematic. Ethiopia has one of the lowest levels of assisted deliveries in the region. Although increases in the number of health workers particularly in rural areas may have contributed to improving access to some health services, it is in the government's interest to further improve the stock, distribution, and performance of relevant health workers in Ethiopia, particularly to bring about improvement in access to maternal health services for the poor.

This timely volume contributes important new findings on the dynamics of education systems and labor market outcomes in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). It analyzes an important recent shift in labor market trends in LAC: the first decade of the 21st century has witnessed a marked decline in the earnings premia for university and secondary education. This, in turn, is contributing to reduced income inequality across the region. The recent trend contrasts with the sharp rise in tertiary earnings premia that was observed in the 1990s and that helped to reinforce high levels of income inequality in the region at that time. The authors recommend that, having achieved very large increases in secondary and tertiary enrollment, the region should now focus on improving the quality of its education systems and the pertinence of education curricula for the needs of the labor market. At age 15, the learning achievement of the average Latin American student still lags two years behind his or her Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) contemporary. The study opens up an important agenda for future research. While the evidence presented on the trends in education earnings premia is clear, the conclusions about the causes and significance of those trends are largely based on suggestive evidence for a limited number of countries, and are not definitive because of data limitations. The findings call for further in-depth analysis of the nature of skill mismatches, to inform policies that can strengthen the region's future economic growth by enhancing the productivity and earnings potential of the workforce.", "subjectTags": ["able students", "acquisition of skills", "adult populations", "basic skills", "call", "cognitive skills", "college graduate", "curricula", "demand for education", "dropout rates", "early childhood", "economic growth", "educated workers", "education attainment", "education investment", "education level", "education levels", "education of children", "education programs", "education quality", "education spending", "education system", "education systems", "educational attainment", "educational attainments", "educational choices", "educational decisions", "educational expansion", "educational history", "educators", "effects of education", "enrollment", "expansion of education", "family life", "formal education", "generic skills", "grade levels", "high school", "household surveys", "human development", "indexes", "investment in education", "labor force", "labor market", "leadership", "learning", "learning achievement", "learning achievements", "learning needs", "learning outcomes", "let", "level of education", "levels of education", "literacy", "literacy skills", "mathematics", "negative effects", "new entrants", "nutrition", "occupations", "papers", "parental education", "parity", "peer review", "performance in mathematics", "personality", "poor performance", "primary education", "primary graduates", "quality of education", "reading", "returns to education", "rigorous analysis", "school dropout", "school dropouts", "school effects", "school graduate", "school graduates", "school level", "schooling", "schools", "secondary education", "secondary level", "secondary school", "significant challenges", "skill training", "skilled workers", "skilled workforce", "social behavior", "student achievement", "student assessment", "teachers", "teaching", "technical education", "tertiary education", "test scores", "training programs", "types of education", "university education", "vocational education", "young people"], "pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2236/665190PUB0EPI00skills09780821389713.pdf?sequence=1", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2236/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2236", "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2236/665190PUB0EPI00skills09780821389713.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "title": "Skills for the 21st Century in Latin America and the Caribbean", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2236", "pubtype": ["Directions in Development ; human development"], "issueDate": "2012-03-19T08:44:15Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2228": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2228/9780821389720.pdf.jpg?sequence=5", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2228/662350PUB0EPI000India09780821389720.txt?sequence=2", "title": "The Remittance Market in India : Opportunities, Challenges, and Policy Options", "abstract": "In chapter one, this report maps the patterns and characteristics of migration flows from India; in chapter two, it provides a detailed discussion of remittance flows to India in terms of their importance, sources, uses, trends, costs, and links to financial access.

Macroeconomic data and forecasts are easily available when crises strike. But policy action requires not only understanding the magnitude of a macro shock, but also identifying which households or individuals are being hurt by (or benefit from) the crisis. Moreover, in many cases, impacts on the ground might be already occurring as macro developments become known, while micro level evidence is still unavailable because of paucity of data. Because of these reasons, a comprehensive real-time understanding of how the aggregate changes will translate to impacts at the micro level remains elusive. This problem is particularly acute when dealing with developing countries where household data is sporadic or out of date. This volume outlines a more comprehensive approach to the problem, showcasing a micro simulation model, developed in response to demand from World Bank staff working in countries and country governments in the wake of the global financial crisis of 2008-09. During the growing catastrophe in a few industrialized countries, there was rising concern about how the crisis would affect the developing world and how to respond to it through public policies. World Bank staff s was scrambling to help countries design such policies; this in turn required information on which groups of the population, sectors and regions the crisis would likely affect and to what extent. The volume is organized as follows. Chapter 1 summarizes the methodology underlying the micro simulation model to predict distributional impacts of the crisis, along with several case studies that highlight how the model can be used in different country contexts. Chapters 2 to 4 are written by experts external to the Bank, two of whom participated as discussants at a workshop on the micro simulation work organized in May, 2010 at the World Bank headquarters. Chapter 2 comments on the broader implications and shortcomings of applying the technique described in Chapter 1 and the ability or willingness of governments to respond adequately to its results. Chapter 3 draws parallels between the United States and developing countries to discuss the lessons that can be learned for mitigating the impacts of future crises. Chapter 4 discusses how the micro simulation approach can be sharpened to make it a better tool for distributional analysis moving forward.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2229", "subjectTags": ["accounting", "aggregate employment", "aggregate inequality", "aggregate output", "anti-poverty", "anti-poverty programs", "average income", "beneficiaries", "calorie intake", "constant poverty line", "counterfactual", "crises", "data requirements", "demographic changes", "developed countries", "developed world", "developing countries", "developing world", "development institutions", "distributional effects", "distributional impact", "economic conditions", "economic growth", "elasticity", "empirical evidence", "empirical work", "employment impacts", "employment status", "extreme poverty", "extreme poverty lines", "farmers", "female employment", "female participation", "financial crisis", "financial markets", "food basket", "food price", "food prices", "food requirements", "general equilibrium", "general equilibrium models", "global markets", "growth rates", "historical data", "household data", "household heads", "household income", "household incomes", "household members", "household survey", "impact on poverty", "income", "income distribution", "income distributions", "income gains", "income groups", "income growth", "income level", "income levels", "income scale", "income shock", "income shocks", "income source", "income sources", "incomes", "individual countries", "inequality", "inequality measures", "innovations", "insurance", "labor force", "labor force participation", "labor market", "labor markets", "macroeconomic mismanagement", "macroeconomic shocks", "middle class", "national poverty", "new poor", "nominal wages", "nutrition", "occupations", "outputs", "participation rates", "per capita income", "policy changes", "policy decisions", "policy design", "policy interventions", "policy measures", "political economy", "poor", "poor households", "poor rural households", "population growth", "poverty estimates", "poverty gap", "poverty headcount", "poverty headcount rate", "poverty impact", "poverty impacts", "poverty increase", "poverty indices", "poverty line", "poverty lines", "poverty programs", "poverty rate", "poverty rates", "poverty reduction", "price changes", "private transfers", "productivity", "public policies", "public transfers", "real output", "relative importance", "relative prices", "rents", "rural", "rural areas", "rural household", "rural income", "safety", "safety net", "safety net programs", "safety nets", "significant differences", "social assistance", "social benefits", "social policy", "social programs", "sustainable development", "targeting", "transfer programs", "unemployed", "unemployment", "unemployment benefits", "unemployment rate", "wages", "young workers"], "pubtype": ["World Bank Study"], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2229/662370PUB0EPI00t0know09780821389812.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2229/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2229", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T08:44:04Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2235": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2235/665200PUB0EPI00rkbook09780821388785.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2235/665200PUB0EPI00rkbook09780821388785.txt?sequence=2", "title": "A Workbook on Planning for Urban Resilience in the Face of Disasters : Adapting Experiences from Vietnam???s Cities to Other Cities", "abstract": "This workbook is intended to help policy makers in developing countries plan for a safer future in urban areas in the face of natural disasters and the consequences of climate change. It is based on the experiences of three cities in Vietnam, Can Tho, Dong Hoi, and Hanoi, that worked with international and local experts under World Bank supervision to develop local resilience action plans (LRAPs) in 2009-10. An LRAP is a detailed planning document that reflects local concerns and priorities based on the experiences of the past and projections for the future. It is not a wish list of projects that may never be completed because they are too costly or lack political support. Rather, it should be a realistic document that describes and establishes priorities for specific steps that can be undertaken in the near term to adapt to both climate related and other hazards. Regardless of their size, location, political orientation, or technical capacity, other cities can learn from the experiences of these pilot cities to develop their own LRAPs. The purpose of this workbook is to adapt the initial experiences of Can Tho, Dong Hoi, and Hanoi to benefit the national government and other communities in Vietnam and beyond. Indeed, the process described in this workbook was later adopted in the cities of Iloilo, the Philippines; Ningbo, China; and Yogyakarta, Indonesia, and the concluding chapter of this workbook draws on some of the lessons learned in these cities.
