Improvements in child health and malaria in particular can be attributed to strong government commitment towards health results, reflected in a number of notable policies and programs related to Human Resources for Health (HRH), in particular the health extension worker program. However, indicators related to maternal health remain problematic. Ethiopia has one of the lowest levels of assisted deliveries in the region. Although increases in the number of health workers particularly in rural areas may have contributed to improving access to some health services, it is in the government's interest to further improve the stock, distribution, and performance of relevant health workers in Ethiopia, particularly to bring about improvement in access to maternal health services for the poor. This document reviews the current HRH situation in Ethiopia, summarizes the evidence on population use of select health services, and offers relevant policy options to assist the government finalize its new human resources strategy and address remaining health challenges.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2226", "subjectTags": ["abortion", "abortion care", "access to care", "access to education", "access to health care", "access to health services", "aged", "antenatal care", "babies", "basic health", "basic health services", "bulletin", "certification", "child health", "cities", "clinics", "community health", "country of destination", "death rate", "deaths", "decision making", "developing countries", "dissemination", "doctors", "drugs", "emergency obstetric care", "employment", "environmental health", "equality of opportunity", "equitable access", "eye care", "families", "family planning", "female", "females", "gender", "general practitioner", "general practitioners", "gross domestic product", "health care", "health care facilities", "health care provider", "health care services", "health centers", "health centre", "health expenditure", "health expenditures", "health extension", "health facilities", "health indicators", "health management", "health messages", "health organization", "health outcomes", "health posts", "health professional", "health professionals", "health providers", "health results", "health sector", "health service", "health services", "health systems", "health systems strengthening", "health training", "health workforce", "health-seeking behavior", "hiv", "hiv/aids", "home visits", "hospital", "hospitals", "household income", "hr", "human immunodeficiency virus", "human resource management", "human resources", "immigration", "immunization", "immunodeficiency", "income", "infant", "infant health", "infant health care", "information system", "intervention", "iron", "job security", "labor force", "labor market", "labor markets", "laboratory workers", "large population", "legal status", "live births", "living conditions", "local community", "malaria", "malaria cases", "maternal and child health", "maternal care", "maternal health", "maternal health services", "maternal mortality", "maternal mortality ratio", "maternal mortality ratios", "maternity care", "maternity leave", "medical care", "medical doctor", "medical doctors", "medical education", "medical school", "medical schools", "medicine", "midwife", "midwifery", "midwives", "migrants", "migration", "millennium development goals", "ministry of education", "ministry of health", "minority", "morbidity", "mortality", "mortality rate", "mother", "mothers", "neonatal health", "neonatal mortality", "newborn", "newborn care", "nurse", "nurses", "nursing", "obstetrics", "paramedics", "patient", "patient satisfaction", "patients", "pharmacist", "pharmacists", "pharmacy", "physician", "physicians", "policy discussions", "policy implications", "policy-making process", "population data", "postnatal care", "potential migrants", "potential users", "pregnancy", "pregnant mothers", "premature death", "prevalence", "probability", "progress", "public health", "public health provision", "public health workers", "push factors", "quality assurance", "rural areas", "rural communities", "rural residents", "sanitation", "school curricula", "school health", "school students", "secondary education", "secondary school", "secondary school education", "sex", "sexual violence", "short supply", "sick leave", "socioeconomic differences", "specialist", "specialists", "surgery", "teaching hospitals", "technical assistance", "tetanus", "training opportunities", "treatment", "urban areas", "urban bias", "urban populations", "victims", "workers", "working conditions", "workplace", "world health organization", "young women"], "pubtype": ["World Bank Study"], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2226/662180PUB0EPI00pia0health0workforse.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2226/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2226", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T08:43:52Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2228": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2228/9780821389720.pdf.jpg?sequence=5", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2228/662350PUB0EPI000India09780821389720.txt?sequence=2", "title": "The Remittance Market in India : Opportunities, Challenges, and Policy Options", "abstract": "In chapter one, this report maps the patterns and characteristics of migration flows from India; in chapter two, it provides a detailed discussion of remittance flows to India in terms of their importance, sources, uses, trends, costs, and links to financial access.

Macroeconomic data and forecasts are easily available when crises strike. But policy action requires not only understanding the magnitude of a macro shock, but also identifying which households or individuals are being hurt by (or benefit from) the crisis. Moreover, in many cases, impacts on the ground might be already occurring as macro developments become known, while micro level evidence is still unavailable because of paucity of data. Because of these reasons, a comprehensive real-time understanding of how the aggregate changes will translate to impacts at the micro level remains elusive. This problem is particularly acute when dealing with developing countries where household data is sporadic or out of date. This volume outlines a more comprehensive approach to the problem, showcasing a micro simulation model, developed in response to demand from World Bank staff working in countries and country governments in the wake of the global financial crisis of 2008-09. During the growing catastrophe in a few industrialized countries, there was rising concern about how the crisis would affect the developing world and how to respond to it through public policies. World Bank staff s was scrambling to help countries design such policies; this in turn required information on which groups of the population, sectors and regions the crisis would likely affect and to what extent. The volume is organized as follows. Chapter 1 summarizes the methodology underlying the micro simulation model to predict distributional impacts of the crisis, along with several case studies that highlight how the model can be used in different country contexts. Chapters 2 to 4 are written by experts external to the Bank, two of whom participated as discussants at a workshop on the micro simulation work organized in May, 2010 at the World Bank headquarters. Chapter 2 comments on the broader implications and shortcomings of applying the technique described in Chapter 1 and the ability or willingness of governments to respond adequately to its results. Chapter 3 draws parallels between the United States and developing countries to discuss the lessons that can be learned for mitigating the impacts of future crises. Chapter 4 discusses how the micro simulation approach can be sharpened to make it a better tool for distributional analysis moving forward.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2229", "subjectTags": ["accounting", "aggregate employment", "aggregate inequality", "aggregate output", "anti-poverty", "anti-poverty programs", "average income", "beneficiaries", "calorie intake", "constant poverty line", "counterfactual", "crises", "data requirements", "demographic changes", "developed countries", "developed world", "developing countries", "developing world", "development institutions", "distributional effects", "distributional impact", "economic conditions", "economic growth", "elasticity", "empirical evidence", "empirical work", "employment impacts", "employment status", "extreme poverty", "extreme poverty lines", "farmers", "female employment", "female participation", "financial crisis", "financial markets", "food basket", "food price", "food prices", "food requirements", "general equilibrium", "general equilibrium models", "global markets", "growth rates", "historical data", "household data", "household heads", "household income", "household incomes", "household members", "household survey", "impact on poverty", "income", "income distribution", "income distributions", "income gains", "income groups", "income growth", "income level", "income levels", "income scale", "income shock", "income shocks", "income source", "income sources", "incomes", "individual countries", "inequality", "inequality measures", "innovations", "insurance", "labor force", "labor force participation", "labor market", "labor markets", "macroeconomic mismanagement", "macroeconomic shocks", "middle class", "national poverty", "new poor", "nominal wages", "nutrition", "occupations", "outputs", "participation rates", "per capita income", "policy changes", "policy decisions", "policy design", "policy interventions", "policy measures", "political economy", "poor", "poor households", "poor rural households", "population growth", "poverty estimates", "poverty gap", "poverty headcount", "poverty headcount rate", "poverty impact", "poverty impacts", "poverty increase", "poverty indices", "poverty line", "poverty lines", "poverty programs", "poverty rate", "poverty rates", "poverty reduction", "price changes", "private transfers", "productivity", "public policies", "public transfers", "real output", "relative importance", "relative prices", "rents", "rural", "rural areas", "rural household", "rural income", "safety", "safety net", "safety net programs", "safety nets", "significant differences", "social assistance", "social benefits", "social policy", "social programs", "sustainable development", "targeting", "transfer programs", "unemployed", "unemployment", "unemployment benefits", "unemployment rate", "wages", "young workers"], "pubtype": ["World Bank Study"], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2229/662370PUB0EPI00t0know09780821389812.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2229/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2229", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T08:44:04Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2385": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2385/656550REPLACEM00Box365720B0Breeding.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2385/656550REPLACEM00Box365720B0Breeding.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Breeding Latin American Tigers : Operational Principles for Rehabilitating Industrial Policies", "abstract": "The specific structure of the book is as follows: chapter one reviews the current situation of Latin America, which historically has been a laggard in economic performance. Chapter two introduces the first principle: the urgency of developing a medium- to long-term strategy for productive transformation based on industrial policies. Chapter three focuses on the principle that strategies for productive transformation with modern industrial policies should rest on effective, locally grown public-private alliances. Chapter four introduces and illustrates principles 3-6, which focus on the 'how' of public sector leadership in the public-private alliance and the formulation and execution of strategies. Chapter five presents and illustrates principles 7-11, which are concerned with the public sector management of support programs and incentives. Chapter six shifts the focus to Latin America. It reviews the past and current nature of development strategies in the region, pointing to their strengths and weaknesses as tools for guiding productive transformation. In chapter seven, the author follow the path of principles 3-11 to critically evaluate the nature of public sector leadership in strategy execution and the modes for managing programs and incentives. Finally, chapter eight presents our central conclusions, which suggest that while some countries in Latin America have been planting the seeds of these 11 principles gleaned from our extra-regional

Asia", "abstract": "This book challenges policy makers who oversee the rice sector in Southeast Asia to reexamine deep-rooted precepts about their responsibilities. As an essential first step, it calls on them to redefine food security. Fixating on national self-sufficiency has been costly and counterproductive. In its stead, coordination and cooperation can both improve rice production at home and structure expanding regional trade. To enhance regional food security through quantitative and qualitative gains in rice production, policy makers cannot solely rely on government programs. They need to also enlist private investors both as entrepreneurs and as partners who can bring capital, energy, modern technology, and experienced management into sustained efforts to reduce losses and heighten efficiency in supply chains. For such investors and participants to enter vigorously into the rice sector from which they have long held back, they will need a number of incentives, among them a confidence that the regional market for rice will evolve toward a structured, liberalized market shielded from the unilateral government interventions that have distorted it in the past and continue to do so in the present. The study's findings make it clear that current rice sector policies are not achieving their desired goals. Its examination of the 2007-08 food crises found, in fact, that government policies and panicky responses were the primary factors behind soaring (and later diminishing) rice prices. Those policies vary, but they share a common premise: food security depends, first of all, on self-sufficiency in rice. That premise has driven government intervention for decades, and unpredictable government intervention, in turn, has been a significant factor in making the rice sector too risky to attract significant private investment. The transition that this study urges will be difficult and, of necessity, slow to gain momentum. Nevertheless, it is already beginning. The members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are working to liberalize trade in the region. The study is, in fact, intended to assist in implementing policy objectives outlined in the ASEAN Integrated Food Security (AIFS) framework and in the strategic plan of action on food security in the ASEAN Region 2009-2013, in which the heads of member states pledged to embrace food security as a matter of permanent and high priority.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2384", "subjectTags": ["adverse consequence", "adverse effects", "aggregate demand", "agribusiness", "agricultural commodity", "agricultural commodity prices", "agricultural cooperatives", "agricultural development", "agricultural inputs", "agricultural markets", "agricultural policies", "agricultural practices", "agricultural production", "agricultural productivity", "agricultural products", "agricultural services", "agriculture", "animal feed", "animal products", "aquaculture", "bank loans", "beef", "cassava", "cereal prices", "cereals", "certification standards", "cimmyt", "commercial farming", "commodity", "commodity prices", "comparative advantage", "competitive advantage", "competitiveness", "consumer prices", "consumers", "contract farming", "contract farming arrangements", "contractual arrangements", "corn", "crop", "crop production", "crop yields", "crops", "dairy", "domestic market", "domestic market prices", "domestic markets", "e-commerce", "economic life", "economic rents", "economic research", "economies of scale", "energy prices", "exchange rates", "expenditure", "expenditures", "export market", "exports", "famine", "fao", "farm", "farmer", "farmer organizations", "farmers", "farming", "farming households", "farms", "fertilizer", "fertilizer prices", "food availability", "food chain", "food crisis", "food distribution", "food emergency", "food grains", "food policy", "food policy research", "food price stability", "food prices", "food production", "food products", "food safety", "food security", "food staples", "food supplies", "food supply", "food trade", "foods", "foreign competition", "free trade", "gdp", "government expenditures", "grain", "grain prices", "grains", "green revolution", "gross domestic product", "harvesting", "harvests", "hybrid seed", "hybrid seeds", "ifpri", "inefficiency", "infrastructure investments", "innovation", "international food policy research institute", "international maize and wheat improvement center", "international rice research institute", "international trade", "inventories", "inventory", "irri", "lamb", "land use", "large mills", "livelihoods", "local millers", "maize", "maize imports", "maize market", "maize prices", "maize production", "maize research", "maize sector", "maize supply", "market access", "market conditions", "market development", "market performance", "meat", "merchandise", "merchandising", "millers", "milling equipment", "milling industry", "milling sector", "mills", "monopolies", "monopoly", "national food security", "oils and fats", "opportunity cost", "paddy", "poor households", "pork", "poultry", "price index", "price indexes", "price setting", "price stability", "price stabilization", "price supports", "price volatility", "private mills", "produce", "product quality", "production costs", "production of rice", "profit maximization", "regional markets", "regulatory systems", "retail", "retailing", "rice", "rice marketing", "rice milling", "rice price", "rice prices", "rice procurement", "rice production", "rice research", "rice trade", "rubber", "sale", "sales", "seed", "seeds", "side effects", "small millers", "small-scale farmers", "soybean", "spread", "statistical analysis", "stocks", "sugar", "supermarket", "supermarkets", "suppliers", "supply chain", "supply chains", "tax expenditures", "technical assistance", "trade policy", "trade reforms", "warehouse", "warehouses", "wheat", "white maize", "wholesalers", "world market", "world markets", "world trade organization", "wto", "yellow maize", "yields"], "pubtype": ["Direction in Development ; trade"], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2384/659560PUB0EPI105737B0Trusting0Trade.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2384/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2384", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:05:17Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2387": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2387/660480PUB0EPI10mbating0malnutrition.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2387/660480PUB0EPI10mbating0malnutrition.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Combating Malnutrition in Ethiopia : An Evidence-Based Approach for Sustained Results", "abstract": "Malnutrition can be transient like an acute disease. More often, it is chronic, a lifelong, intergenerational condition beginning early in life and continuing into old age. Most under-nutrition starts during pregnancy and the first two years of life. After a child reaches 24 months of age, damage from early malnutrition is irreversible. Various indicators are commonly used to measure and monitor malnutrition, including rates of stunting, wasting, and underweight among children under five years of age (see the glossary for definitions and explanations). Stunting is a measure of long-term, chronic malnutrition. Wasting is a measure of more transient, acute, but reversible malnutrition. These two measures are often not highly correlated. Underweight is a composite index of stunting and wasting; an underweight child can be stunted, wasted, or both. The government of Ethiopia formulated and approved the first National Nutrition Strategy in February 2008 to concentrate efforts on reducing malnutrition. The National Nutrition Program was approved in December 2008 to implement the strategy following a programmatic approach. The Ministry of Health is the lead agency overseeing the program and implementing its key aspects; other ministries and sectors are also involved in the multisectoral effort to reduce malnutrition.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2387", "subjectTags": ["malnutrition"], "pubtype": ["Africa Human Development Series"], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2387/660480PUB0EPI10mbating0malnutrition.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2387/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2387", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:05:21Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2412": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2412/530940PUB0HIV0101Official0Use0only1.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2412/530940PUB0HIV0101Official0Use0only1.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Accelerating the Education Sector Response to HIV : Five Years of Experience from Sub-Saharan Africa", "abstract": "The work described in this review shows the commitment of education teams throughout Africa to contribute to the multisectoral response to HIV/AIDS. It is also a testament to the leadership shown by ministries of education, in helping the new generation of children and youth grow up better able to challenge HIV, and in providing care and support for the educators who often represent more than half the public sector workforce. The work described in this review does not suggest any single solution. Instead, the approach is based on the recognition that Africa is a diverse continent, and countries need to find their own local approaches to the epidemic. The Regional Economic Communities (RECs) of the African Union have been instrumental in encouraging locally specific responses, and recognizing that HIV knows no frontiers, in coordinating responses among neighbors. The countries of East, Central, and West Africa, working through the RECs, have created sub-regional networks of ministry of education HIV/AIDS focal points; these networks have been key to sharing information and developing capacity, and so to accelerating and strengthening responses at the national level. The review shows how, over the last five years, the leadership in ministries of education has been crucial in mobilizing these activities, and also emphasizes that effective implementation depends on the full participation of all stakeholders. Education staff, educators, and learners all have a role to play, as do parent-teacher associations, teachers' unions and the many civil society organizations, including faith-based organizations that are so important in the non-formal sector. The review also demonstrates the commitment of the development partners, and their efforts to harmonize their contribution toward strengthening the education agenda.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2412", "subjectTags": ["absenteeism", "access for orphans", "access to education", "access to information", "acquired immune deficiency syndrome", "addition", "adult education", "aid", "aids committee", "aids committees", "aids prevention", "aids relief", "aids service organizations", "anti-aids", "basic education", "broadcasting", "child development", "children with disabilities", "civil society groups", "civil society organizations", "communities", "creative thinking", "curricula", "curriculum", "decision making", "discrimination", "donor support", "education for all", "education ministries", "education sector", "education systems", "educational development", "educational planning", "effective education", "equal access", "full participation", "full potential", "gender", "gender disparities", "gender gap", "girls", "global campaign for education", "health education", "hiv", "hiv education", "hiv infection", "hiv infection rates", "hiv infections", "hiv prevention", "hiv/aids", "human immunodeficiency virus", "immune deficiency", "immunodeficiency", "inclusion", "instruction", "interventions", "knowledge sharing", "languages", "leadership", "learning", "learning materials", "life education", "life skills", "literature", "mainstream", "mainstreaming", "movement", "national aids councils", "national curriculum", "national education", "new infections", "nongovernmental organizations", "nutrition", "orphan", "orphans", "parent-teacher associations", "peer education", "peer educators", "philosophy", "prevention education", "prevention efforts", "primary education", "primary schooling", "primary schools", "quality education", "quality of education", "response to aids", "risk of infection", "risky behavior", "school system", "school teachers", "school-age children", "schooling", "secondary education", "secondary schools", "sexually transmitted diseases", "societies", "society", "speaking", "sports", "teacher absenteeism", "teacher training", "teachers", "teaching", "technical support", "training centers", "translation", "tuberculosis", "unaids", "universal access", "universities", "visually impaired", "vocational training", "voluntary counseling", "vulnerable children", "world health organization", "worth", "young people", "youth"], "pubtype": ["Education and HIV/AIDS"], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2412/530940PUB0HIV0101Official0Use0only1.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2412/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2412", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:32:58Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2381": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2381/659570PUB0EPI10737B0Rents0to0Riches.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2381/659570PUB0EPI10737B0Rents0to0Riches.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Rents to Riches?

In this vein, the volume presents an analytical framework for assessing a country's political economy and institutional environment as it relates to natural resource management and, on that basis, it offers a substantial set of targeted prescriptions across the natural resource value chain that are technically sound and compatible with the identified underlying incentives. In other words, the objective of this book is to help development practitioners unravel the political economy dynamics surrounding natural resource management in order to complement their technically grounded engagement. To this end, the analytical approach has been two-pronged. First, case studies were conducted on the political economy of the hydrocarbon and mineral value chains in 13 countries in the Africa, East Asia and Pacific, and Latin America and the Caribbean regions. Second, in light of this empirical material, the book highlights the current frontier of applied political economy analysis on resource dependence.

After a history of recurrent instability and crisis (a trademark of the region), they now seem well poised for rapid expansion. Since the last wave of financial crises that swept through the region in the late 1990s and early 2000s, financial systems in LAC have continued to gain in soundness, depth, and diversity. The size of banking systems has increased, albeit from a low base; local currency bond markets have greatly developed, both in volumes and in reach over the yield curve; stock markets have expanded; and derivative markets particularly currency derivatives have grown and multiplied. Institutional investors have become more important relative to banks, making the financial system more complex and diversified. Importantly, much progress has been made in financial inclusion, particularly through the expansion of payments, savings, and credit services to lower income households and microenterprises. As evidence of their new soundness and resiliency, financial systems in the region, except in some Caribbean countries, weathered the recent global financial crisis remarkably well. The progress in financial development in LAC no doubt reflects substantial improvements in the enabling environment, lower macroeconomic volatility, more independent and better-anchored currencies, increased financial liberalization, lower currency mismatches and foreign debt exposures, enhanced effectiveness of regulation and supervision, and notable improvements in the underlying market infrastructures (for example, trading, payments, custody, clearing, and settlement). This regional flagship report aims at providing such a stocktaking and forward looking assessment of the region's financial development. Rather than going into detail about sector-specific issues, the report focuses on the main architectural issues, overall perspectives, and interconnections. The value added of the report thus hinges on its holistic view of the development process, its broad coverage of the financial services industry (not just banking), its emphasis on benchmarking, its systemic perspective, and its explicit effort to incorporate the lessons from the recent global financial crisis.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2380", "subjectTags": ["accountability", "authority", "basic education", "betterment taxes", "bond issues", "borrowing", "borrowing arrangements", "budget deficits", "capital cities", "capital planning", "capital projects", "central government", "central governments", "central transfers", "citizens", "civil service", "constitution", "constitutions", "corruption", "creditworthiness", "debt", "debt financing", "decentralization", "decentralization in government", "decentralization process", "decision-making", "decision-making power", "decree", "democracy", "democratic reforms", "devolution", "economic conditions", "employment", "expenditure", "expenditure responsibilities", "federal government", "fiscal", "fiscal balance", "fiscal decentralization", "fiscal management", "fiscal pressures", "fiscal reform", "government assistance", "government authority", "government budgets", "government expenditures", "government revenues", "government services", "health services", "housing", "intergovernmental finance", "intergovernmental fiscal relations", "intergovernmental transfers", "lack of transparency", "laws", "legal changes", "legislation", "levels of government", "local authorities", "local government", "local governments", "local tax", "local taxes", "matching grants", "ministers", "municipal debt", "municipal governments", "municipalities", "municipality", "national governments", "national legislatures", "national taxes", "nations", "property taxes", "provincial governments", "public employment", "public finance", "public funds", "public officials", "public services", "public works", "referendums", "resource mobilization", "retail sales tax", "revenue sharing", "revenue sources", "revenue transfers", "revolution", "roads", "savings", "service capacity", "state banks", "tax authority", "tax collections", "tax rates", "tax receipts", "tax revenues", "local financing", "user charges", "decision-making process", "democratization", "democratic values", "local officials", "public service finance", "reforms", "transition"], "pubtype": ["World Bank Latin America and the Caribbean Studies"], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2380/657440SPANISH0065774B09780821394908.pdf.jpg?sequence=13", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2380/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2380", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:05:13Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2383": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2383/656590REPLACEM0hieving0World0Class0.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2383/656590REPLACEM0hieving0World0Class0.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Achieving World-Class Education in Brazil : The Next Agenda", "abstract": "Education is improving in Brazil. The average years of education has almost doubled over the last 20 years, as has the proportion of adults who have completed secondary school. Brazil's high school students have improved consistently in math and language performance over the last decade. These gains stem from the federal government's priority attention to education through both reforms and resources over the past 15 years. The progress laid out in this book is impressive and praiseworthy, but Brazil still trails its competitors in several of the ways that matter most. Student learning, while improving, still lags far behind wealthier nations. Many secondary schools lose the majority of their students well before graduation. Teachers are drawn from among the lowest achievers and have few performance incentives, and it shows in how class time is used. This important book explores not only the basis for Brazil's progress, but also what it must do to bridge the remaining quality gap to a first-rate education for its children. It provides detailed recommendations for strengthening the performance of teachers, supporting children's early development, and reforming secondary education.

The challenge is particularly acute in Sub-Saharan Africa, home to two-thirds (22.5 million) of the people living with HIV/AIDS globally, and where HIV/AIDS has become the leading cause of premature death. But now, after decades of misery and frustration with the disease, there are signs of hope. HIV prevalence rates in Africa are stabilizing. This book sheds light on these concerns by analyzing the fiscal implications of HIV/AIDS in Southern Africa, the epicenter of the epidemic. It uses the toolbox of public finance to assess the sustainability of HIV/AIDS programs. Importantly, it highlights the long-term nature of the fiscal commitments implied by HIV/AIDS programs, and explicitly discusses the link between HIV infections and the resulting commitments of fiscal resources. The analysis shows that, absent adjustments to policies, treatment is not sustainable. But it also shows that, by accompanying treatment with prevention, and making existing programs more cost-effective, these countries can manage both treatment and fiscal sustainability. Even in countries where HIV/AIDS-related spending is high or increasing (as past infections translate into an increasing demand for treatment), the fiscal space absorbed by the costs of HIV/AIDS-related services will decline if progress in containing and rolling back the number of new infections can be sustained. The purpose of this study is to refine the analysis of the fiscal burden of HIV/AIDS on national governments and assess the fiscal risks associated with scaling-up national HIV/AIDS responses. The study complements and contributes to the agenda on identifying and creating fiscal space for HIV/AIDS and other development expenditures. The findings from this study, and the analytical tools developed in it, could help governments in defining policy objectives, improving fiscal planning, and conducting their dialogue with donor agencies.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2382", "subjectTags": ["absenteeism", "acquired immunodeficiency syndrome", "affected communities", "aids epidemic", "awareness campaigns", "behavior change", "climate", "commercial sex", "commercial sex workers", "communities", "community action", "community participation", "councils", "decentralization", "decision-making", "development process", "discrimination", "drug users", "education", "effective prevention", "exercises", "expenditure", "families", "gender equality", "girls", "government authority", "government level", "government roles", "health", "health care", "health services", "hiv", "hiv positive", "housing", "human immunodeficiency virus", "human resources", "ideas", "immunodeficiency", "income", "intervention", "labor productivity", "labor supply", "leadership", "levels of government", "local authorities", "local government", "local government authorities", "local governments", "managers", "media", "ministries of health", "municipal management", "municipality", "national aids councils", "national governments", "nations", "orphans", "partnership", "patients", "primary health care", "private sector", "public health", "representatives", "resource mobilization", "risk factors", "service delivery", "sex workers", "social welfare", "society", "transmission", "unaids", "urban areas", "voluntary counseling", "vulnerable children", "acquired immune deficiency syndrome", "hiv viruses", "epidemics", "handbooks", "community participation", "local government", "local nongovernmental entities", "civil society", "government role", "governance capacity", "interagency coordination", "disease prevention & control", "resources mobilization", "monitoring criteria"], "pubtype": [], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2382/656580REPLACEM00B0Fiscal0Dimensions.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2382/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2382", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:05:15Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2418": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2418/533000PUB0comm1B1Official0Use0Only1.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2418/533000PUB0comm1B1Official0Use0Only1.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Local and Community Driven Development : Moving to Scale in Theory and Practice", "abstract": "Services are failing poor urban and rural people in the developing world, and poverty remains concentrated in rural areas and urban slums.

After a comprehensive overview, chapters 1 and 2 provide the necessary background for the air transport sector and the evolution of private sector participation and investment in airport infrastructure. In chapter 3, questionnaires submitted to airport operators and regulators led to the creation of the unique data sets, which were first used to compare performance across 14 partial performance indicators, and next used to develop aggregate measures of efficiency necessary for the benchmarking exercise. In chapter 4, a qualitative study of the relationship between type of regulating agency (independent or government-led) and transparency, accountability, and bureaucracy provides insight into how recent reforms have also affected the quality of regulatory governance. Chapter 5 provides an in-depth analysis of the evolution of tariff structures in the region as compared to a sample of international airports. Several important topics were not included in this report but should be the focus of future research. In particular, the evolution of the quality of services in airports deserves greater attention, as airports are increasingly becoming business centers and key gateways for trade competitiveness. The other main topic that requires detailed practical research is climate change and its relationship with the airport sector.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2389", "subjectTags": ["access to airports", "accountability", "accounting", "accounting manuals", "adequate investment", "adequate representation", "aeronautical charges", "aeronautical tariff", "aeronautical tariffs", "air", "air cargo", "air cargo traffic", "air freight", "air navigation", "air traffic", "air traffic control", "air traffic control system", "air transport", "air transport association", "air transport demand", "air transport infrastructure", "air transport market", "air transport sector", "air travel", "airbus", "aircraft", "aircraft movements", "aircraft parking", "aircrafts", "airline", "airlines", "airport", "airport capacity", "airport charges", "airport concessions", "airport efficiency", "airport industry", "airport infrastructure", "airport investment", "airport investments", "airport management", "airport operations", "airport operator", "airport operators", "airport ownership", "airport regulation", "airport runway", "airport sector", "airport service", "airport services", "airport tariffs", "airport terminal", "airport traffic", "airport traffic report", "airports", "airports concession", "autonomy", "bridge", "capital costs", "capital flows", "cargo aircraft", "cargo hub", "cargo traffic", "city airport", "civil aviation", "civil aviation authority", "climate change", "concession contracts", "concession scheme", "concessionaires", "construction", "consumer price index", "copyright clearance", "copyright clearance center", "cost of capital", "demonstration effects", "deregulation", "developing countries", "divestiture", "domestic passengers", "domestic traffic", "drivers", "due diligence", "economic crisis", "economic development", "economic growth", "economic performance", "economic regulation", "economics", "economics of infrastructure", "economies of scale", "effects of ownership", "efficiency of airports", "elasticity", "elasticity of demand", "employment", "exchange rate", "financial closure", "financial crises", "financial efficiency", "financial support", "financing sources", "fleets", "freight", "fuel", "fuel prices", "generation", "government ownership", "growth in demand", "growth in passenger demand", "growth rates", "handling", "hub airports", "income", "income elasticity", "infrastructure investments", "infrastructure projects", "infrastructure services", "international air transport", "international air transport association", "international airport", "international airports", "international civil aviation", "international civil aviation organization", "international flights", "international passengers", "international trade", "international traffic", "investment climate", "labor costs", "landing", "large cities", "lease contract", "lease contracts", "lower tariffs", "ministry of transport", "national civil aviation agency", "navigation charges", "number of aircraft", "number of aircraft movements", "operating costs", "operating margins", "operation and maintenance", "operation of airports", "passenger aircraft", "passenger numbers", "passenger traffic", "passengers", "passengers per employee", "performance indicators", "private airport operators", "private capital", "private capital flows", "private financing", "private infrastructure", "private investment", "private investment in airports", "private investments", "private operators", "private providers", "private sector participation", "privatization", "productivity", "psp", "public investment", "public policies", "public sector", "public-private partnerships", "rail", "railways", "range", "rate of return", "reference", "regulator", "regulators", "regulatory agencies", "regulatory agency", "regulatory framework", "remote", "revenue per passenger", "road", "roads", "runway", "savings", "single concession", "square", "subsidiary", "surcharges", "sustainable development", "tariff structure", "tax", "tax laws", "terminal", "terminals", "trade flows", "traffic demand", "traffic growth", "traffic movement", "transparency", "transport alternatives", "transport infrastructure", "transport management", "transport market", "transport projects", "transport research", "transport services", "transports", "travelers", "true", "upper", "urban transport", "utilities", "water distribution"], "pubtype": ["Directions in Development ;

Like wind power itself, the scope of this report is worldwide although special attention is paid to the issues characteristic of the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region. While the principal focus is on land-based wind power, it also briefly addresses the environmental and social impacts related to off shore wind development. Wind power today is widely regarded as a key component of an environmentally sustainable, low-carbon energy future because it is renewable, requires almost no water, and generates near-zero emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants. In many parts of the world, wind power has the potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from electric power generation, thereby helping to limit the severe environmental and social consequences of human-induced climate change. The growth of wind power has also occurred due to its other positive attributes, including growing economic competitiveness.

The workshops turned out to be intense, lively affairs, lasting up to three days. It became clear that experts do not always agree, even on issues that are central to growth. But the Commission had no wish to disguise or gloss over these uncertainties and differences. And it did not want to present a false confidence in its conclusions beyond that justified by the evidence. While researchers will continue to improve people's understanding of the world, policy makers cannot wait for scholars to satisfy all of their doubts or resolve their differences. Decisions must be made with only partial knowledge of the world. One consequence is that most policy decisions, however well informed, take on the character of experiments, which yield useful information about the way the world works, even if they do not always turn out the way policy makers had hoped. It is good to recognize this fact, if only so that policy makers can be quick to spot failures and learn from mistakes. In principle, a commission on growth could have confined its attention to income per person, setting aside the question of how income is distributed. But this commission chose otherwise. It recognized that growth is not synonymous with development. To contribute significantly to social progress, growth must lift everyone's sights and improve the living standards of a broad swath of society. The Commission has no truck with the view that growth only enriches the few, leaving poverty undisturbed and social ills untouched.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2458", "subjectTags":

"Throughout the developed and developing world there is growing demand for policies that would facilitate access to jobs by the most vulnerable, improve their earnings, and reduce their dependency on public support. As a result, governments are increasingly focused on removing obstacles faced by employers to create jobs and on instilling incentives for individuals to re-enter the labor market or to move toward more productive employment possibilities. Severance pay a program compensating formal workers for dismissal by employers or with an end-of-service benefit is often blamed for distorting employer hiring and firing decisions. Together with restrictive labor market regulations and other formal labor market features, this program is held responsible for excessive job protection with a negative impact on labor market outcomes, in particular affecting the most vulnerable. Despite this strong negative assessment among many labor market economists, surprisingly little is known about this program that exists in most countries around the world as a legally mandated benefit. This lack of knowledge may derive from the special 'positioning' of the program between labor code and social insurance; its origins were in the first policy domain, but its objectives for key programs were replicated in the second domain in particular unemployment and retirement benefits. This is the first-ever book to shed light on this program in a comprehensive manner its historical origins, its rationale, and its characteristics across the world. It reviews the soundness of the empirical accusation, assesses recent country reforms, and offers policy reform alternatives and policy guidance. The policy directions include folding severance pay into existing social insurance programs, where they exist, and to make severance pay contractual between market partners as a way to enhance efficiency in a knowledge-based economy. Folding severance pay into employment benefits may also be an opportunity to move away from unemployment insurance, which is fraught by moral hazard, toward a promising 'hybrid' system of unemployment insurance savings accounts supplemented by social pooling.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2369", "subjectTags": ["accounting", "additional income", "adequate income", "administrative costs",

Emerging Stronger from the Crisis", "abstract": "East Asia has recovered from the economic and financial crisis. Largely thanks to China, the region's output, exports and employment have mostly returned to the levels before the crisis. Leading the global economy, real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in developing East Asia is poised to rise to 8.7 percent in 2010 after slowing from 8.5 percent in 2008 to 7.0 percent in 2009. This report also identifies two common regional agenda items for the medium term. First, the process of regional integration, driven by Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) commitments to creating a single economic area, will need to continue. Deeper regional economic integration is now even more important, given prospects for slower growth in advanced economies. Behind-the-border trade barriers must be lowered, even in the face of incipient protectionist pressures around the world, including in the region. Deeper integration will encourage agglomeration economies and intra-industry trade, support sustainable urbanization, lower costs, and increase international competitiveness. Second, addressing climate change is high priority in the region. Mitigation measures must be strengthened to improve land and water use, bolster energy efficiency and conservation, and foster a much larger role for renewable sources of energy. Moreover, with investment rates in the region higher than in developed countries, there is scope for East Asia to move rapidly to the \"green\" technology frontier. Such a move will give the region a competitive advantage in a sector poised for rapid global growth. At the same time, the adaptation agenda will require enhancing the region's cooperation and disaster risk management frameworks.

Although scarce, HIV incidence data support findings of high acquisition and transmission risks among MSM in multiple contexts, cultural settings, and economic levels. Research among MSM in LMICs has been limited by the criminalization and social stigmatization of these behaviors, the safety considerations for study participants, the hidden nature of these populations, and a lack of targeted funding. Available evidence from these countries suggests that structural risks social, economic, political, or legal factors in addition to individual-level risk factors are likely to play important roles in shaping HIV risks and treatment and care options for these men.

It also reports on the achievements of trust fund activities, financed by the Bank Netherlands Partnership Program (BNPP), that were implemented parallel to the GEF/World Bank projects. The MBC is a land-use planning system that spans Central America and Mexico. It is designed to promote the conservation and sustainable use of the region's natural resources. The overall objective of the Bank's MBC projects of consolidating the MBC was highly relevant. Although the Central American land bridge is very small, it is estimated to be home to 12 percent of the world's known species. It harbors approximately 24,000 species of vascular plants and over 500 species of mammals, many of which are endemic.

functions in organization for economic co-operation and development countries. In most of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries, it even impedes competitiveness. The most common economic benefits of adopting standards include increased productive and innovative efficiency. Standards lead to economies of scale, allowing suppliers to achieve lower costs per unit by producing large, homogeneous batches of products. Standards spur and disseminate innovation, solve coordination failures, and facilitate the development of profitable networks. Participation in world trade increasingly requires that suppliers comply with standards determined by lead buyers in global value chains. The nature of participation in the global economy has changed dramatically over the past two decades. Rarely do producers turn raw materials into final products and sell them directly to customers. Improving the quality of goods and services and diversifying into sectors where quality matters can be a sustainable source of global competitiveness. Some of the productive tasks associated with high-quality goods have high learning and technological externalities. In those sectors, producers tend to form tight relationships with global buyers who transfer their knowledge and support the producers' quality-upgrading processes. Diversifying into a broad range of sectors also reduces macroeconomic volatility, but quality upgrading becomes necessary to enter new sectors that compete on quality.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2305", "subjectTags": ["capabilities", "classrooms", "communities", "communities of practice", "content providers", "distance learning", "documents", "knowledge sharing", "knowledge transfer", "leadership", "learning", "learning activities", "learning centers", "learning experiences", "management system", "marketing", "material", "menu", "multimedia", "networks", "pedagogy", "professional development", "programs", "reading", "reading materials", "recognition", "results", "support staff", "technical experts", "underlying assumptions", "universities", "users", "web"], "pubtype": [], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2305/618960PUB0Harn000public00BOX358355B.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2305/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2305", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:03:45Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2304": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2304/618950PUB0Heal000public00BOX358355B.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2304/618950PUB0Heal000public00BOX358355B.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Healthy Partnerships : How Governments Can Engage the Private Sector to Improve Health in Africa", "abstract": "Health systems across Africa are in urgent need of improvement. The public sector should not be expected to shoulder the burden of directly providing the needed services alone, nor can it, given the current realities of African health systems. Therefore to achieve necessary improvements, governments will need to rely more heavily on the private health sector. Indeed, private providers already play a significant role in the health sector in Africa and are expected to continue to play a key role, and private providers serve all income levels across sub- Saharan Africa's health systems. The World Health Organization (WHO) and others have identified improvements in the way governments interact with and make use of their private health sectors as one of the key ingredients to health systems improvements. Across the African region, many ministries of health are actively seeking to increase the contributions of the private health sector. However, relatively little is known about the details of engagement; that is, the roles and responsibilities of the players, and what works and what does not. A better understanding of the ways that governments and the private health sector work together and can work together more effectively is needed. This Report assesses and compares the ways in which African governments are engaging with their private health sectors. Engagement is defined, for the purposes of this report, to mean the deliberate, systematic collaboration of the government and the private health sector according to national health priorities, beyond individual interventions and programs. With effective engagement, one of the main constraints to better private sector contributions can be addressed, which in turn should improve the performance of health systems overall.", "uri":

"abstract": "Around the world, countries are becoming urbanized at an astonishing pace. As countries develop economically, their economies shift from mainly rural and agrarian to increasingly urban and nonagricultural. This rural-urban transformation presents both opportunities and challenges for development. When managed effectively, the transformation spurs growth and reduces poverty. When managed poorly, however, the process can result in stark welfare disparities, the marginalization of entire regions, and poorly functioning cities that fail to realize the potential gains from agglomeration economies. This book investigates the rural-urban transformation underway in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, emphasizing the influence of country conditions as well as the potential of good policies to minimize disparities and ensure that everyone shares in the benefits of urbanization. The first part of this book investigates urbanization and rural-urban welfare inequalities on three geographic scales global, national, and local featuring countries and cities in Sub-Saharan Africa on the national and local levels. The second part of the book sheds light on the texture of transformation in five countries in South Asia, each at a different stage in the process: Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.",

It also provides introductions to the methods used by ADePT and a step-by-step guide to their implementation in the program. ADePT is a software package that generates standardized tables and charts summarizing the results of distributional analyses of household survey data. ADePT health is just one of several modules; other modules include poverty, inequality, labor, social protection, and gender. ADePT health has two sub modules: health outcomes and health financing. Together these modules cover a wealth of topics in the areas of health equity and financial protection. This manual is divided into two parts corresponding to each of these sub modules. The following topics are covered: part 1, health outcomes: (a) measuring inequalities in outcomes and utilization (with and without standardization for need), (b) decomposing the causes of health sector inequalities, and (c) analyzing the incidence of government spending (that is, benefit incidence analysis); and part 2, health financing: (a) financial protection, including catastrophic payments and impoverishing payments, and (b) the progressivity and redistributive effect of health financing.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2306", "subjectTags": ["ability to pay", "ailments", "applicable law", "blood pressure", "capita health expenditure", "catastrophic health spending", "child health", "chronic condition", "determinants of health", "doctor", "doctors", "economic review", "employment", "epidemiology", "expenditures", "father", "female", "financial protection", "gender", "health care", "health care financing", "health care providers", "health care utilization", "health centers", "health data", "health determinants", "health economics", "health equity", "health expenditure", "health expenditures", "health facilities", "health finance", "health financing", "health indicators", "health inequalities", "health inequality", "health insurance", "health insurance scheme", "health organization", "health outcomes", "health sector", "health seeking behavior", "health services", "health status", "healthcare", "hospital admissions", "hospitals", "household budgets", "household expenditure", "household income", "illness", "illnesses", "immunization", "incidence analysis", "income", "income distribution", "income groups", "indexes", "inequities in health care", "infant mortality", "informal payments", "injury", "inpatient admission", "inpatient care", "inpatient treatment", "insurance", "insurance coverage", "living standards", "morbidity", "mortality", "mother", "national health", "national_health", "nutrition", "outpatient care", "patients", "pocket payments", "policy research", "primary health care", "public health", "public health care", "public health services", "public providers", "public sector", "public spending", "school health", "school health care", "social health insurance", "social security", "traditional medicine", "under-five mortality", "visits", "walking", "woman", "workers"], "pubtype": [], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2306/622580PUB0heal01476B0extop0id018459.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2306/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2306", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:03:46Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2301": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2301/618090PUB0ifc00Box358352B000PUBLIC0.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2301/618090PUB0ifc00Box358352B000PUBLIC0.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Assessing IFC's Poverty Focus and Results", "abstract": "Growth is good for the poor, but the impact of growth on poverty reduction depends on both the pace and the pattern of growth. A pattern of growth that enhances the ability of poor women and men to participate in, contribute to, and benefit from growth should not come at the expense of a slower pace of growth. Including the poor in the growth process is also good for the pace of growth. This relationship underscores the critical importance of the pattern of growth for poverty reduction. The International Finance Corporation's (IFC) mission is to create opportunities for people to escape poverty and improve their lives. It pursues this mission by promoting growth through support for private sector development. Attention to the type of growth that the institution supports is therefore critical for the fulfillment of its mission. IFC's approach in this respect has evolved over the years: from support to private sector-led growth in general, to promoting environmentally and socially sustainable growth, to, more recently, beginning to pay explicit attention to inclusive growth. There have been different perspectives of how IFC's support for private sector development is helping to tackle poverty. Yet, there is not enough clarity about what poverty means within the IFC context and how its interventions reach and affect the poor.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2301", "subjectTags": ["absolute poverty", "access to employment", "access to markets", "access to services", "accounting", "average incomes", "beneficiaries", "beneficiary", "beneficiary groups", "capacity building", "capacity building program", "capital base", "cas", "collateral", "collateral registries", "comparative advantage", "corrective actions", "country assistance strategies", "country level", "credit bureaus", "developing countries", "development bank", "development economics", "development goals", "development report", "development strategy", "dimensions of poverty", "disadvantaged groups", "dispute resolution", "distributional effects", "distributional pattern", "economic activities", "economic activity", "economic development", "economic growth", "economic opportunities", "empirical evidence", "empirical literature", "employment opportunities", "evaluation activities", "expenditures", "exporters", "farm employment", "financial infrastructure", "financial intermediaries", "financial markets", "financial sector", "financial support", "financial sustainability", "food prices", "foreign direct investment", "foreign direct investments", "frontier regions", "geographic targeting", "global business", "global partnership", "global trade", "gross domestic product", "growth pattern", "growth process", "growth rates", "human development", "incidence of poverty", "income", "income differential", "income generation", "income inequality", "infrastructure projects", "intangible", "international bank", "international development", "international finance", "intervention", "investment activities", "investment climate", "investment climates", "investment opportunities", "investment portfolio", "investment projects", "investment strategies", "learning", "livelihood", "livelihood opportunities", "livelihoods", "living standards", "market economies", "market failures", "market mechanisms", "measuring poverty", "microfinance", "microfinance institutions", "non-income dimensions", "nonexperimental design", "nongovernmental organizations", "payment systems", "per capita income", "poor", "poor countries", "poor families", "poor people", "poor women", "poverty characteristics", "poverty database", "poverty effects", "poverty focus", "poverty impact", "poverty impacts", "poverty index", "poverty maps", "poverty outcomes", "poverty rates", "poverty reduction", "poverty reduction objective", "poverty reduction objectives", "poverty reduction outcomes", "private financing", "private investment", "private investments", "pro-poor", "pro-poor growth", "programs", "project beneficiaries", "project objectives", "promoting growth", "public sector", "qualitative assessments", "rate of return", "rates of return", "reduced poverty", "reducing poverty", "reduction in poverty", "regional averages", "remote rural areas", "resource allocation", "returns", "risk management", "rural", "rural areas", "rural households", "rural investment", "rural poor", "sanitation", "sector activities", "securities", "securities markets", "service delivery", "settlement", "share of investment", "share of investments", "spatial distribution", "structural adjustment", "structural adjustment policies", "sustainable development", "sustainable growth", "targeting", "tax", "trade finance", "transition countries", "understanding of poverty", "urban areas", "vulnerable groups", "widespread poverty"], "pubtype": [], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2301/618090PUB0ifc00Box358352B000PUBLIC0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2301/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2301", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:03:38Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2300": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2300/616360PUB0REPL0d0EPI009780821382578.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2300/616360PUB0REPL0d0EPI009780821382578.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Leveraging Migration for Africa : Remittances, Skills, and Investments", "abstract": "International migration has profound implications for human welfare, and African governments have had only a limited influence on welfare outcomes, for good or ill.

The book comprises this introduction and summary and four chapters. Chapter one reviews the data on African migration and considers the challenges African governments face in managing migration. Chapter two discusses the importance of remittances, the most tangible link between migration and development; it also identifies policies that can facilitate remittance flows to Africa and increase their development impact. Chapter three analyzes high-skilled emigration and analyzes policies that can limit adverse implications and maximize positive implications for development. Chapter four considers ways in which Africa can leverage its diaspora resources to increase trade, investment, and access to technology.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2300", "subjectTags":

On the basis of their pragmatic value in guiding decisions, needs assessments are used in various professions and settings from emergency rooms to corporate boardrooms to guide decision making. Nonetheless, although needs assessments have many different applications, in this book on needs assessments as they are applied in organizations to accomplish results, as opposed to their use in personal decisions or medical triage. This book, in turn, is guide to assessing needs and then making essential decisions about what to do next. This book filled with practical strategies, tools, and guides covers both large-scale, formal needs assessments and less-formal assessments that guide daily decisions. Included in the book is a blend of rigorous methods and realistic tools that can help make informed and reasoned decisions. Together, these methods and tools offer a comprehensive, yet realistic, approach to identifying needs and selecting among alternative ways as go forward. Sections one and two offer quick, yet full, answers to many frequently asked questions regarding how to make justifiable decisions. Next, section three examines a variety of tools and techniques that can be used for both collecting information and making decisions. Appendix A then offers a number of checklists and guides for managing the systematic assessment processes that lead to quality decisions. Finally, the reference list at the end of the book is a valuable resource to research, tools, and discussions of needs assessment.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2231", "subjectTags": ["agricultural development", "agricultural laboratories", "agricultural practices", "agricultural production", "agricultural products", "agriculture", "analytical laboratories", "animal diseases", "animal health", "animal products", "aquaculture", "bank lending", "bombs", "capacity building", "cash management", "chemistry", "civil service status", "conflict of interest", "conflicts of interest", "contingency planning", "cost effectiveness", "crops", "cross contamination", "dairy", "dairy products", "decision making", "developing countries", "developing country", "development projects", "domestic market", "domestic markets", "dried fruit", "economic development", "economic risks", "egg", "emergency plans", "emergency response", "environmental health", "epidemiology", "equipment", "equipments", "expenditures", "export growth", "export performance", "exporter", "exporters", "extension", "extension services", "farmers", "farms", "fee income", "feed", "finances", "financial management", "financial sustainability", "fiscal autonomy", "fish", "fish processing", "fisheries", "fixed assets", "food control", "food handling", "food industries", "food industry", "food processing", "food production", "food products", "food regulations", "food safety", "food testing", "foreign market", "foreign markets", "fruit products", "funding mechanisms", "government funding", "government policies", "government regulations", "government support", "grapes", "groundnuts", "hazard", "hazards", "health care", "health management", "health regulations", "health services", "honey", "housing", "human capital", "human capital development", "human resources", "hygiene", "incomes", "infectious diseases", "international bank", "international cooperation", "international financial institution", "international financial institutions", "international organizations", "international standard", "international standards", "international support", "international trade", "investing", "investment alternatives", "investment climate", "investment decisions", "investment projects", "isolation", "issuance", "lab", "laboratories", "laboratory", "laboratory infrastructure", "labs", "lamb", "laws", "legal system", "level playing field", "livestock", "livestock products", "loan", "market access", "market country", "marketing", "meat", "ministries of agriculture", "national laboratory", "needs assessment", "nuts", "ownership structure", "parasites", "pathogens", "pesticide", "pesticides", "pests", "plant products", "political economy", "poor reputation", "poultry products", "private investment", "private investments", "private sector", "profit margin", "proteins", "public budget", "public budgeting", "public funds", "public health", "public investment", "public services", "quality control", "regulation of food", "regulatory constraints", "regulatory framework", "regulatory system", "reserve", "reserves", "return", "returns", "risk management", "rural development", "seafood", "soils", "spinach", "trading", "transition countries", "transition economies", "transparency", "trustees", "turnover", "universities", "veterinary services", "waste", "waste disposal", "world trade"], "pubtype": [], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2231/663920PUB0EPI00essing09780821388686.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2231/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2231", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T08:44:08Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2230": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2230/662320PUB0EPI00turing09780821389836.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2230/662320PUB0EPI00turing09780821389836.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Out-of-Court Debt Restructuring", "abstract": "This study provides a conceptual framework for the analysis of the questions of out-of-court debt restructuring from a policy-oriented perspective.

Actually, the study contemplates different restructuring techniques as forming a continuum to the treatment of financial difficulties. The study discusses the advantages and disadvantages of all the debt restructuring techniques, and concludes, in this regard, that a legal system may contain a number of options a menu that can cover different sets of circumstances. In the end, the law may offer a toolbox with very different instruments that the parties may use depending on the specific facts of the case.

Ascent after Decline: Regrowing Global Economies after the Great Recession identifies the main challenges to the economic recovery, such as rising debt levels, reduced trade prospects, and global imbalances, as well as the obstacles to growth posed by fiscal conundrums and lagging infrastructure. It also examines the way forward, beginning with the role of the state and then covering labor markets, information technology, and innovation. The common thread throughout the book is the view that economic re-growth will depend in large measure on smart policy choices and that the role of government has never been more crucial than at any time since the great depression. As members of the World Bank community, these issues are of particular importance to us, since without a resurrection of strong economic growth in major economies, the likelihood of rapid economic development in poorer developing countries is dampened. This is troubling because we have seen progress in many parts of the globe in the past decade, including in Africa, and these gains will be arrested as long as the global economy is in disarray. Donors will withdraw, investment will retrench, and prospects will dim. This immiserizing welfare outcome is to be avoided. The volume is intended to shed light on those areas of policy that reduce the prospects of a prolonged period of stress and decline by 'regrowing growth.'", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2233",

Policy", "abstract": "The new structural economics argues that the best way to upgrade a country's endowment structure is to develop its industries at any specific time according to the comparative advantages determined by its given endowment structure at that time. The economy will be most competitive, the economic surplus will be the largest, and the capital accumulation and the upgrading of factor endowment structure will be the fastest possible. The 'New Structural Economics' presented in this book is an attempt to set out this third wave of development thinking. Taking into account the lessons learned from the growth successes and failures of the last decades, it advances a neoclassical approach to study the determinants and dynamics of economic structure. It postulates that the economic structure of an economy is endogenous to its factor endowment structure and that sustained economic development is driven by changes in factor endowments and continuous technological innovation. The paper also discusses binding constraints to growth in each of these industries' value chains as well as mechanisms through which governance-related issues in the implementation of industrial policy could be addressed.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2232", "subjectTags": ["growth"], "pubtype": [], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2232/663930PUB0EPI00nomics09780821389553.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2232/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2232", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T08:44:09Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2235": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2235/665200PUB0EPI00rkbook09780821388785.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2235/665200PUB0EPI00rkbook09780821388785.txt?sequence=2", "title": "A Workbook on Planning for Urban Resilience in the Face of Disasters : Adapting Experiences from Vietnam???s Cities to Other Cities", "abstract": "This workbook is intended to help policy makers in developing countries plan for a safer future in urban areas in the face of natural disasters and the consequences of climate change. It is based on the experiences of three cities in Vietnam, Can Tho, Dong Hoi, and Hanoi, that worked with international and local experts under World Bank supervision to develop local resilience action plans (LRAPs) in 2009-10. An LRAP is a detailed planning document that reflects local concerns and priorities based on the experiences of the past and projections for the future. It is not a wish list of projects that may never be completed because they are too costly or lack political support. Rather, it should be a realistic document that describes and establishes priorities for specific steps that can be undertaken in the near term to adapt to both climate related and other hazards. Regardless of their size, location, political orientation, or technical capacity, other cities can learn from the experiences of these pilot cities to develop their own LRAPs. The purpose of this workbook is to adapt the initial experiences of Can Tho, Dong Hoi, and Hanoi to benefit the national government and other communities in Vietnam and beyond. Indeed, the process described in this workbook was later adopted in the cities of Iloilo, the Philippines; Ningbo, China; and Yogyakarta, Indonesia, and the concluding chapter of this workbook draws on some of the lessons learned in these cities.

With growth stagnating and unemployment soaring in much of the world, educators are being asked to focus more on producing skills that feed into labor productivity and support the sustainable growth of employment and incomes. This timely volume contributes important new findings on the dynamics of education systems and labor market outcomes in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). It analyzes an important recent shift in labor market trends in LAC: the first decade of the 21st century has witnessed a marked decline in the earnings premia for university and secondary education. This, in turn, is contributing to reduced income inequality across the region. The recent trend contrasts with the sharp rise in tertiary earnings premia that was observed in the 1990s and that helped to reinforce high levels of income inequality in the region at that time. The authors recommend that, having achieved very large increases in secondary and tertiary enrollment, the region should now focus on improving the quality of its education systems and the pertinence of education curricula for the needs of the labor market. At age 15, the learning achievement of the average Latin American student still lags two years behind his or her Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) contemporary. The study opens up an important agenda for future research. While the evidence presented on the trends in education earnings premia is clear, the conclusions about the causes and significance of those trends are largely based on suggestive evidence for a limited number of countries, and are not definitive because of data limitations. The findings call for further in-depth analysis of the nature of skill mismatches, to inform policies that can strengthen the region's future economic growth by enhancing the productivity and earnings potential of the workforce.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2236", "subjectTags": ["able students", "acquisition of skills", "adult populations", "basic skills", "call", "cognitive skills", "college graduate", "curricula", "demand for education", "dropout rates", "early childhood", "economic growth", "educated workers", "education attainment", "education investment", "education level", "education levels", "education of children", "education programs", "education quality", "education spending", "education system", "education systems", "educational attainment", "educational attainments", "educational choices", "educational decisions", "educational expansion", "educational history", "educators", "effects of education", "enrollment", "expansion of education", "family life", "formal education", "generic skills", "grade levels", "high school", "household surveys", "human development", "indexes", "investment in education", "labor force", "labor market", "leadership", "learning", "learning achievement", "learning achievements", "learning needs", "learning outcomes", "let", "level of education", "levels of education", "literacy", "literacy skills", "mathematics", "negative effects", "new entrants", "nutrition", "occupations", "papers", "parental education", "parity", "peer review", "performance in mathematics", "personality", "poor performance", "primary education", "primary graduates", "quality of education", "reading", "returns to education", "rigorous analysis", "school dropout", "school dropouts", "school effects", "school graduate", "school graduates", "school level", "schooling", "schools", "secondary education", "secondary level", "secondary school", "significant challenges", "skill training", "skilled workers", "skilled workforce", "social behavior", "student achievement", "student assessment", "teachers", "teaching", "technical education", "tertiary education", "test scores", "training programs", "types of education", "university education", "vocational education", "young people"], "pubtype": ["Directions in Development ; human development"], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2236/665190PUB0EPI00skills09780821389713.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2236/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2236", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T08:44:15Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2238": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2238/666080PUB0EPI00sector09780821388570.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2238/666080PUB0EPI00sector09780821388570.txt?sequence=2", "title": "The Status of the Education Sector in Sudan", "abstract": "This publication is the first comprehensive overview of the education sector in Sudan.

It serves as a powerful reminder that recovering the proceeds of corruption is a collective responsibility that involves both the public and private sector. Law enforcement and prosecution cannot go after stolen assets, confiscate and then return them if they are hidden behind the corporate veil. All financial centers and developed countries have committed, through the UN Convention against Corruption and international anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism standards, to improving the transparency of legal entities and other arrangements.

"abstract": "Drug use and abuse is one of the most difficult challenges facing the contemporary world. If it is true that there has always been consumption of different types of drugs in different societies, although not in all of them, it is no less true that it generally took place in restricted, socially regulated realms, especially in ritualistic ceremonies. This is not the case today. Drug use has spread to all segments of society, with hedonistic motivations; although it is often not socially sanctioned, users are at times, depending on the drug, treated with leniency. It is well-established that all drugs are harmful to the health, even the legal ones, such as alcohol and tobacco, and that some drugs are more harmful, such as heroin and crack. The discussion of 'gateway drugs' is a medical issue on which there is no consensus. For the purposes of public policy design, the important thing to keep in mind is that drugs produce negative consequences for both users and societies in general, and that minimizing their consumption should be the main goal. The salient discussion, therefore, is about choosing among different strategies to achieve the same goal. Most of all, this book contributes to the debate by shedding light on the understanding of the economics and logistics of the drug market.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2420", "subjectTags": ["drugs"], "pubtype": [], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2420/536410PUB0Inno101Official0Use0Only1.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2420/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2420", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:33:10Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2421": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2421/536420PUB0Migr101Official0Use0Only1.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2421/536420PUB0Migr101Official0Use0Only1.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Migration and Skills : The Experience of Migrant Workers from Albania, Egypt, Moldova, and Tunisia", "abstract": "The subject of migration, and how best to manage it, has been moving up the policy agenda of the European Union for some time now. Faced with an aging population, possible skills shortages at all skills levels, and the need to compete for highly skilled migrants with countries such as Australia, Canada, and the United States, the European Union (EU) is moving from seeing migration as a problem or a threat to viewing it as an opportunity. As an EU agency promoting skills and human capital development in transition and developing countries, the European Training Foundation (ETF) wished to explore the impact of migration on skills development, with a special emphasis on Diasporas and returning migrants. For the World Bank, the issue of migration forms an integral part of its approach to social protection, since it believes that labor-market policy must take into account the national as well the international dimensions of skilled labor mobility. Both institutions were keen to look at what changes need to be made to migration policy in order to achieve a triple-win situation, one that can benefit both sending and receiving countries as well as the migrants themselves. This report aims to unravel the complex relationship between migration and skills development. It paints a precise picture of potential and returning migrants from four very different countries, Albania, the Arab Republic of Egypt, Moldova, and Tunisia, that is a conscious choice of two 'traditional' (Egypt, Tunisia) and two 'new' (Albania, Moldova) sending countries, and describes the skills they possess and the impact that the experience of migration has on their skills development. It is harder to draw accurate conclusions on the link between job aspirations and current employment status, since many of the potential migrants were not actively employed at the time of the interview. However, the data suggest people did expect to change jobs as a result of migration, and the sectors they expected to work in varied according to their nationality. Focusing solely on those planning to move to the EU, many Albanians expected to work in domestic service, hospitality, and construction; Egyptians expected to work in hospitality and construction; Moldovans expected to work in domestic service and construction; and Tunisians expected to work in hospitality and manufacturing. Few migrants working in agriculture or petty trade aimed to work in these same sectors while abroad.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2421", "subjectTags": ["access to education", "adult education", "adult population", "archaeology", "asylum", "asylum policy", "basic education", "brain drain", "citizen", "citizens", "citizenship", "consequences of migration", "countries of origin", "country of origin", "cultural change", "current population", "demographic changes", "demographic transition", "developing countries", "development policies", "diaspora", "dissemination", "economic growth", "educated men", "educated women", "education systems", "educational attainment", "emergency situations", "emigrants", "emigration", "emigration policies", "employment generation", "entrepreneurship", "equal opportunities", "expatriates", "families", "family members", "family reunification", "female migrants", "fertility", "fertility rate", "fertility rates", "fewer women", "financial constraints", "flow of migrants", "formal education", "gender", "gender bias", "government programs", "health care", "home countries", "host countries", "host country", "households", "human capital", "human development", "illegal migrants", "immigrants", "immigration", "immigration countries", "immigration policy", "immigration system", "impact of migration", "income-generating activities", "information dissemination", "information system", "insurance", "international migration", "international organization for migration", "international policy", "international trade", "irregular migration", "job opportunities", "labor market", "labor markets", "labor migration", "labor shortages", "laws", "legal status", "level of education", "levels of education", "lifelong learning", "local community", "local development", "local economy", "long-term residents", "marital status", "migrant", "migrant workers", "migrants", "migration", "migration flows", "migration for employment", "migration issues", "migration patterns", "migration policies", "migration policy", "migration process", "minority", "mobility", "municipalities", "national strategy", "nationals", "number of children", "number of people", "pensions", "policies on migration", "policy change", "policy development", "policy discussions", "potential contribution", "potential migrants", "public debate", "push factor", "quality of education", "refugee", "remigration", "remittances", "remittances from migrants", "research techniques", "return migration", "return of migrants", "returnees", "savings", "secondary education", "significant policy", "skilled migrants", "skilled workers", "skills development", "social affairs", "social capital", "social change", "social development", "social networks", "social policies", "social sciences", "social security", "social welfare", "societies", "socioeconomic development", "socioeconomic factors", "sociology", "spouse", "subsidiary", "technical assistance", "temporary migration", "tertiary education", "towns", "training centers", "transport", "treaty", "unemployment", "unemployment rates", "villages", "vocational education", "war", "woman", "work experience", "workforce", "working conditions", "young adult", "young adults", "young people"], "pubtype": ["Directions in Development ; human development"], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2421/536420PUB0Migr101Official0Use0Only1.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2421/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2421", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:33:10Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2422": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2422/536430PUB0Broa101Official0Use0Only1.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2422/536430PUB0Broa101Official0Use0Only1.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Broadband for Africa : Developing Backbone Communications Networks", "abstract": "Many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa see information and communication technology (ICT) as a necessary foundation for long-term economic development. While the region has been very successful in increasing access to basic voice communications, there has been no comparable improvement in broadband connectivity. In fact, the broadband access gap between Sub-Saharan Africa and the rest of the world is getting wider just as the gap in basic voice communications is getting smaller. Increasing access to broadband connectivity is therefore emerging as a high priority for policy makers across the continent. This book begins with a brief review of the ICT market and considers the extent of demand for broadband and the ICT services that high-capacity backbone networks make possible. This is followed by a review of the existing coverage of backbone networks in the region, a discussion of how this compares with other parts of the world, and an analysis of the possible explanations for the current pattern of network development.

Concerns about welfare of the rural elderly combine spatial and demographic issues. Large gaps exist between conditions in coastal and interior regions and between conditions in urban and rural areas of the country. In addition to differences in income by geography, considerable differences exist across demographic groups in the level of coverage by safety nets, in the benefits received through the social welfare system, and in the risks of falling into poverty. This book aims to do two things: first, it provides detailed empirical analysis of the welfare and living conditions of the rural elderly since the early 1990s in the context of large-scale rural-to-urban migration, and second, it explores the evolution of the rural pension system in China over the past two decades and raises a number of issues on its current implementation and future directions. Although the two sections of the book are distinct in analytical terms, they are closely linked in policy terms: the first section demonstrates in several ways a rationale for greater public intervention in the welfare of the rural elderly, and the second documents the response of policy to date and options to consider for deepening the coverage and effects of the rural pension system over the longer term.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2249", "subjectTags": ["absolute terms", "access to government", "age distribution", "aging populations", "basic benefit", "basic needs", "basic pension", "benefit level", "benefit levels", "center for population", "changes in fertility", "chronic poverty", "chronically poor", "consumption poverty", "consumption smoothing", "contribution records", "coresidence", "cultural change", "demographic change", "demographic projections", "demographic transition", "demographic trends", "dependency ratio", "dependency ratios", "determinant of poverty", "determinants of poverty", "developing countries", "dissemination", "economic growth", "economic transition", "elderly", "elderly households", "elderly men", "elderly people", "elderly persons", "elderly population", "elderly women", "employment opportunities", "employment status", "family income", "family members", "family planning", "family planning commission", "family size", "family support", "farm labor", "fertility", "fertility policies", "fertility rate", "fertility rates", "funded pensions", "future generations", "global population", "government pensions", "gross domestic product", "guaranteed rate", "health care", "health insurance", "higher incidence of poverty", "household consumption", "household head", "household income", "household incomes", "household poverty", "human capital", "human development", "ill health", "illness", "incidence of poverty", "income distribution", "income inequality", "income poverty", "income quintile", "income risk", "income shock", "income support", "individual account", "individual accounts", "inflation rate", "informal sector", "intergenerational transfers", "internal migration", "labor force participation", "labor income", "labor market", "labor markets", "labor supply", "legal status", "life expectancy", "living conditions", "local capacity", "local development", "local economy", "low fertility", "male labor force", "migrant", "migrant family", "migrant workers", "migrants", "migration", "mortality", "national fertility", "national level", "national pension", "national policy", "nutrition", "old age", "old age support", "old-age", "older people", "pension", "pension benefit", "pension benefits", "pension coverage", "pension income", "pension indicators", "pension policy", "pension policy reform", "pension programs", "pension scheme", "pension schemes", "pension system", "pension systems", "pensionable age", "pensions", "persistent poverty", "policy makers", "policy research", "policy research working paper", "policy response", "political economy", "poor", "poor areas", "poor people", "poor rural households", "poorer households", "population and development", "population census", "population center", "population growth", "population growth rate", "population projections", "population research", "population statistics", "population structure", "population trends", "poverty assessment", "poverty gap", "poverty head", "poverty incidence", "poverty index", "poverty level", "poverty line", "poverty measures", "poverty poverty", "poverty rate", "poverty rates", "poverty severity", "poverty status", "private transfers", "public policy", "public support", "reduction in poverty", "remittance", "remittances", "respect", "retirement", "retirement ages", "retirement decisions", "rural", "rural areas", "rural economy", "rural household", "rural incomes", "rural men", "rural migrants", "rural people", "rural poor", "rural population", "rural population growth", "rural populations", "rural poverty", "rural residents", "rural workers", "safety nets", "savings", "social affairs", "social assistance", "social insurance", "social pension", "social pensions", "social protection", "social protection mechanisms", "social sciences", "social security", "social security benefits", "social security system", "social services", "social support", "social welfare", "spatial differences", "spillover", "spouse", "state university", "support falls", "targeting", "united nations population division", "urban areas", "urban migration", "urban population", "urbanization", "village leaders", "vulnerability", "vulnerability to poverty", "working-age population", "world population", "young adult", "young adults", "young people"], "pubtype": ["Directions in Development ;

Although initial conditions vary widely from country to country, this increase will inevitably intensify pressure on the education system, particularly at the secondary and tertiary levels. African countries may thus find it timely to align their education policies and strategies to the emerging challenges. A key goal is to ensure that the education system continues to develop in an efficient, equitable, and fiscally sustainable manner even as it expands to accommodate the rising numbers seeking a place in secondary and tertiary education. The rest of this report is organized as follows. Chapter two elaborates the policy context for education development in SSA. Chapter three explains the methodology and data sources. Chapter four examines the challenges and constraints posed by the sheer volume of increases in enrollments in post-primary education with which most education systems in SSA must grapple in the coming years. Taking these constraints into account, the report evaluates the scope for policy development from three perspectives in the subsequent chapters: the coverage of education systems (chapter five), the quality and cost of service delivery (chapter six), and the division of financing by public and private sources (chapter seven). The fiscal implications of plausible policy packages that SSA countries might consider are assessed in chapter eight. Chapter nine seems up the general conclusions of the report.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2429", "subjectTags": ["achievement", "advanced training", "age groups", "average class size", "average number of students", "average teacher salaries", "average teacher salary", "basic education", "basic education cycle", "budget for education", "child mortality", "childcare", "class size", "class sizes", "classrooms", "climate change", "curricula", "curriculum", "decision making", "demographic growth", "dependency ratio", "developing countries", "dissemination", "economic growth", "education benchmarks", "education development", "education enrollments", "education for all", "education policies", "education quality", "education sector", "education statistics", "education system", "education systems", "educational aspirations", "educational attainment", "educational development", "educational goals", "educational policy", "educational services", "employment opportunities", "enrollment increases", "fertility", "fertility rates", "financial constraints", "food security", "foreign direct investment", "formal courses", "formal education", "formal education system", "ger", "girls", "grade repetition", "gross domestic product", "gross enrollment", "gross enrollment ratio", "gross national income", "higher education", "human development", "incidence of poverty", "instruction", "instructional hours", "instructional time", "intake rate", "international efforts", "interventions", "investments in education", "labor market", "lam", "leadership", "learning", "learning outcomes", "legal status", "level of education", "levels of education", "life skills", "low-income countries", "lower secondary education", "lower secondary level", "millennium development goal", "millennium development goals", "mother", "national goals", "national leaders", "number of pupils", "number of students", "number of students per class", "policy development", "policy dialogue", "policy discussions", "policy makers", "population growth", "population growth rates", "post-primary education", "primary completion", "primary completion rate", "primary cycle", "primary cycles", "primary education", "primary lower secondary", "primary school", "primary school completion", "primary school completion rate", "primary school completion rates", "primary school enrollments", "primary school leavers", "primary school pupils", "primary school teachers", "primary schools", "primary system", "progress", "provision of services", "public expenditure", "public funds", "pupil-teacher ratio", "quality of services", "quality standards", "rapid population growth", "remittances", "repeaters", "repetition rate", "repetition rates", "resource mobilization", "resource needs", "resources for education", "returns on investment in education", "rural areas", "rural populations", "scarce resources", "school enrollments", "school organization", "school systems", "school teacher", "school-age", "school-age population", "schooling", "secondary school", "secondary school leavers", "secondary school teachers", "secondary schooling", "secondary schools", "secondary students", "service delivery", "skilled professionals", "skills training", "social benefits", "social development", "social impact", "social returns", "social sciences", "social welfare", "student enrollment", "student enrollments", "student flow", "student learning", "student teacher ratio", "student welfare", "student-teacher ratio", "student-teacher ratios", "students per teacher", "sustainable development", "sustainable growth", "target populations", "teacher", "teacher ratios", "teacher salaries", "teachers", "teaching", "tertiary education", "tertiary levels", "tertiary students", "unemployment", "unemployment rate", "universal access", "universal access to schooling", "universal basic education", "universal primary completion", "universal primary education", "universal primary school completion", "universal primary schooling", "vocational education", "vocational training", "workforce", "working population", "world conference", "young people", "youth"], "pubtype": ["Africa Human Development Series"], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2429/538780PUB0post101Official0Use0Only1.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2429/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2429", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:33:22Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2411": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2411/332510PUB0our0dream0Box345588B01PUBLIC1.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2411/332510PUB0our0dream0Box345588B01PUBLIC1.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Our Dream : A World Free of Poverty", "abstract": "Reducing poverty is a complex and difficult challenge. Poverty has many dimensions. It certainly involves lack of human and physical assets and inadequate material means to acquire food and other necessities. But it also means vulnerability to ill-health, drought, job loss, economic decline, violence, and societal conflict. And it often means a deep condition of disempowerment, even humiliation. The history of poverty during the past few decades is diverse: great advances in some dimensions in some regions, but stagnation, even reversals, in others. Progress requires effective public action at both the national and local levels, but this action is in turn profoundly influenced by how a society functions and by the public, private, and nongovernment institutions within a country. And action within a country is powerfully affected by international conditions. The programs and projects presented in this book were selected by a team representing the staff association, the poverty reduction and economic management network, and the external affairs department of the World Bank. To be included, activities had to show poverty impact. Activities still under way had to hold the promise of enhancing the well-being of the poor and contain effective monitoring and evaluation mechanisms so that changes could be made along the way if needed. The country cases presented also include methods for monitoring and evaluation. Impact is what counts. This volume not only shows that effective public action can make a difference to poverty in all its complexity; it also highlights the importance of understanding the impact of development measures on the poor.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2411", "subjectTags": ["poverty"], "pubtype": [], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2411/332510PUB0our0dream0Box345588B01PUBLIC1.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2411/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2411", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:32:58Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2410": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2410/528600PUB0Rura101Official0Use0only1.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2410/528600PUB0Rura101Official0Use0only1.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Gender and Governance in Rural Services : Insights from India, Ghana, and Ethiopia", "abstract": "As the first output from the gender and governance in rural services project, this report presents descriptive findings and qualitative analysis of accountability mechanisms in agricultural extension and rural water supply in India, Ghana, and Ethiopia, paying specific attention to gender responsiveness. The gender and governance in rural services project seeks to generate policy-relevant knowledge on strategies to improve agricultural and rural service delivery, with a focus on providing more equitable access to these services, especially for women. The project focuses on agricultural extension, as an example of an agricultural service, and drinking water, as an example of rural service that is not directly related to agriculture but is of high relevance for rural women. A main goal of this project was to generate empirical micro level evidence about the ways various accountability mechanisms for agricultural and rural service provision work in practice and to identify factors that influence the suitability of different governance reform strategies that aim to make service provision more gender responsive. Three out of four poor people in the developing world live in rural areas, and most of them depend directly or indirectly on agriculture for their livelihoods. Providing economic services, such as agricultural extension, is essential to using agriculture for development. At the same time, the rural poor need a range of basic services, such as drinking water, education, and health services. Such services are difficult to provide in rural areas because they are subject to the \"triple challenge\" of market, state, and community failure. As a result of market failure, the private sector does not provide these services to the rural poor to the extent that is desirable from society's point of view. The state is not very effective in providing these services either, because these services have to be provided every day throughout the country, even in remote areas, and because they require discretion and cannot easily be standardized, especially if they are demand driven. Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and communities themselves are interesting alternative providers of these services, but they too can fail, because of capacity constraints and local elite capture. This triple challenge of market, state, and community failure results in the poor provision of agricultural and rural services, a major obstacle to agricultural and rural development.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2410", "subjectTags": ["access to assets", "access to drinking water", "access to education", "access to irrigation", "access to safe drinking water", "accountability mechanisms", "agricultural activities", "agricultural development", "agricultural extension", "agricultural extension services", "agricultural information", "agricultural inputs", "agricultural marketing", "agricultural practices", "agricultural prices", "agricultural producers", "agricultural productivity", "agricultural research", "agricultural researchers", "agricultural sector", "agricultural services", "agricultural technology", "agriculture", "capacity building", "capacity building program", "capacity constraints", "central region", "clean water", "community organizations", "community resources", "cooperatives", "credit schemes", "crop production", "crop yields", "decentralization", "development projects", "drainage", "drinking water", "drinking water facilities", "economic growth", "economics", "environmental sustainability", "equitable access", "extension agents", "extension services", "family farms", "farmer", "farmer groups", "farmers", "farmers organizations", "farms", "female farmers", "female household members", "female-headed households", "food policy", "food security", "gender", "gender dimensions", "health programs", "household head", "household heads", "household surveys", "household welfare", "hunger", "illiteracy", "income", "incomes", "inequality", "livelihood security", "livelihoods", "livestock", "livestock production", "livestock rearing", "market failures", "maternal mortality", "new technologies", "ngos", "nongovernmental organizations", "nutrition", "political influence", "poor farmers", "poor households", "poor people", "poverty line", "poverty reduction", "private sector", "public services", "regional governments", "regional training", "remote areas", "rural", "rural areas", "rural communities", "rural development", "rural drinking water", "rural households", "rural livelihoods", "rural people", "rural poor", "rural population", "rural service", "rural service delivery", "rural service provision", "rural services", "rural water", "rural water supply", "rural women", "safety net", "sanitation", "smallholder farming", "social capital", "targeting", "transaction costs", "vegetables", "veterinary services", "village assembly", "vulnerable segments", "water resources", "water sources", "wheat production"], "pubtype": [], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2410/528600PUB0Rura101Official0Use0only1.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2410/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2410", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:32:55Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2330": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2330/634050PUB0Qata00Box0361515B0PUBLIC0.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2330/634050PUB0Qata00Box0361515B0PUBLIC0.txt?sequence=2", "title": "The Qatar-Nepal Remittance Corridor : Enhancing the Impact and Integrity of Remittance Flows by Reducing Inefficiencies in the Migration Process", "abstract": "Remittance inflows play a crucial role in Nepal's economy. Officially recorded remittances already amounted to almost a quarter of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2009. The 2008-09 global economic crises resulted in slower growth of remittance inflows in Nepal, leading directly to lower disposable income. This is a telling reminder of the importance of promoting a supportive environment for remittances. Nepali migration continues to increase as workers seek greater economic opportunities abroad. In this quest, Qatar is one of the important migration destinations for Nepali migrant workers. This report analyzes the migration and remittance transfer processes in the Qatar-Nepal Corridor in order to provide policy recommendations that would help improve the scale and impact of remittance transfers from Qatar to Nepal, and enhance the efficiency and integrity of migration and remittances in the corridor. The report identifies challenges in the migration process from Nepal to Qatar (related to high migration costs and their financing) and constraints in the remittance transfer process from Qatar to Nepal, which together limit the development and poverty reduction impact of remittance flows to Nepali households. As this report highlights, the Qatar-Nepal remittance corridor has several distinctive features. First, the majority of remittance flows from Qatar to Nepal are being transferred through officially regulated remittance channels. One of the reasons for this is actually the second feature of this corridor, namely, the officially managed migration process from Nepal to Qatar (as a result of which the majority of migrants are documented workers). The third feature is the contrast between the high competition and low prices of remittance services in this corridor on the one hand, and the contradictory rules and high costs incurred during the migration process on the other hand. Finally, as a by-product of the complex migration process which involves multiple players, financial transfers through informal mechanisms take place from Nepal to Qatar in order to pay the commissions of manpower agencies and middlemen.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2330", "subjectTags": ["abuse", "account-to-account", "accountability", "accounting", "anti-money laundering", "baby", "bank account", "bank accounts", "bank branch", "bank data", "bank drafts", "bank guarantee", "bank guarantees", "banking services", "banks", "best practices", "borrower", "branch network", "bus service", "cash transfer", "cash-to-cash", "central bank", "central banks", "checking accounts", "checks", "collateral", "collect cash", "courier services", "credit guarantee", "credit transfer", "credit transfers", "currency", "currency transaction", "debit cards", "default risk", "deposit", "deposit accounts", "deposits", "developing countries", "development bank", "development banks", "disbursement", "disbursements", "diseases", "dissemination", "due diligence", "economic conditions", "economic development", "economic growth", "economic opportunities", "electronic funds", "electronic funds transfer", "electronic transfers", "emigration", "employment", "exchange commission", "exchange rate", "exchange rate movements", "exchange rates", "family members", "financial flow", "financial information", "financial institution", "financial services", "financial stability", "foreign banks", "foreign currency", "foreign exchange", "foreign exchange rate", "foreign workers", "fraud", "gross domestic product", "host countries", "host country", "human development", "immigration", "income", "informal channels", "informal transfer", "informal transfers", "insurance", "integrity", "interest rates", "international bank", "international money orders", "international money transfer", "international money transfer operators", "issuance", "job opportunities", "labor force", "labor market", "lack of awareness", "laws", "legal frameworks", "legal status", "life insurance", "liquidity", "liquidity management", "liquidity risk", "liquidity risks", "living standard", "loan", "loan repayment", "local banks", "local currency", "local moneylenders", "market competition", "market conditions", "market players", "market share", "middleman", "middlemen", "migrant", "migrant labor", "migrant outflows", "migrant worker", "migrant workers", "migrant workforce", "migrants", "migration", "migration policies", "migration process", "mobile phone", "mobile phones", "monetary fund", "money express", "money gram", "money lender", "money order", "money orders", "money transfer", "money transfer companies", "money transfer operator", "money transfers", "national population", "nationals", "negotiable instruments", "payment services", "payment system", "payment systems", "physical cash transfer", "policy dialogue", "political instability", "political uncertainty", "population division", "population increase", "portfolio", "postal service", "private commercial banks", "pull factors", "push factors", "regulatory constraints", "regulatory framework", "regulatory frameworks", "remittance", "remittance flows", "remittance inflows", "remittance market", "remittance outflows", "remittance services", "remittance transfer", "remittance transfers", "remittances", "repatriation", "repayment", "reproductive health", "reserve", "reserve bank", "reserve bank of india", "reserves", "respect", "return", "rural areas", "savings", "savings accounts", "securities", "service provider", "service providers", "skilled workers", "skills development", "social development", "subsidiary", "tax", "tax deductions", "temporary migration", "terrorism", "trading", "transaction", "transaction costs", "transfer channels", "transfer costs", "transfer fee", "transfer fees", "transfer mechanisms", "transfer of funds", "transfer process", "transfer system", "transparency", "transport", "transportation", "unemployment", "unskilled workers", "wages", "wire transfers", "work migration"], "pubtype": ["World Bank Study"], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2330/634050PUB0Qata00Box0361515B0PUBLIC0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2330/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2330", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:04:14Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2331": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2331/634330PUB0Towa000public00BOX361512B.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2331/634330PUB0Towa000public00BOX361512B.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Toward Better Infrastructure : Conditions, Constraints, and Opportunities in Financing Public-Private Partnerships in Select African Countries", "abstract": "Examining innovative ways to address Africa's infrastructure deficit is at the heart of this analysis.

Section six outlines medium-term options for PPP financing.

in Per Capita Financing Systems", "abstract": "This book reviews the experience with one specific though widely introduced approach to funding general education, namely per capita financing (PCF), in six countries in the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) region in an effort to learn which outcomes were achieved and how. Per capita financing is a type of formula funding of schools-funding characterized by a set of agreed objective criteria for allocating resources to schools, that provides schools fixed amounts of financing based on the numbers of students enrolled. Five of the six case study countries, Armenia, Estonia, Lithuania, Poland and the Russian Federation, were chosen primarily since they represent ECA countries with relatively long experience in implementing PCF schemes. The hope is that, as a result, the likelihood of observing the outcomes of per capita financing is higher. Since per capita financing replaced a school budget allocation process (input-based or normative budgeting) that was non-transparent and conducive to inefficient use and inequitable allocation of resources, the main expected outcomes of the per student finance reform were improved efficiency, equity, and transparency and accountability of public education expenditures.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2332", "subjectTags": ["education"], "pubtype": ["World Bank Study"], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2332/634340PUB0Refo0512B0EXTOP0ID0187830.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2332/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2332", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:04:17Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2333": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2333/634350PUB0Trad01512B0EXTOP0ID018788.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2333/634350PUB0Trad01512B0EXTOP0ID018788.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Trade Expansion through Market Connection : The Central Asian Markets of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan", "abstract": "The five countries of Central Asia expanded their trade significantly since beginning their transition with exports quadrupling to almost USD70 billion between 2003 and 2008 but without substantial diversification.

These include the expected rates of increase in the demand for electricity, the required supply of new generating capacity, the technology and fuel mix of that generating capacity, and the carbon dioxide emissions of the sector. One of the key contributions of this study is the aggregation of individual country plans to the regional and sub regional levels, using a consistent set of data and a common methodology. The report also assesses the important roles of hydropower and natural gas, the way other clean and low-carbon resources can be expanded, the potential and benefits of greater electricity trade, and the role of energy efficiency. By considering the region as a whole, the report highlights the role that individual countries will play in shaping the region's aggregate power sector.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2334", "subjectTags": ["access to electricity", "air", "air conditioners", "approach", "balance", "balance of payments", "baseline emissions", "biomass", "biomass gasifier", "biomass resources", "building codes", "carbon", "carbon dioxide", "carbon dioxide emissions", "carbon energy", "carbon intensity", "carbon offsets", "carbon tax", "carbon taxes", "clean water", "climate", "climate change", "climate change mitigation", "climatic conditions", "co", "co2", "coal", "coal reserves", "coal use", "cogeneration", "colors", "conditioners", "conservation", "cycle technology", "demand for electricity", "demand-side management", "diesel", "distribution losses", "distribution of electricity", "domestic energy", "domestic natural gas", "drought", "economic growth", "efficiency improvements", "efficiency of energy use", "efficiency potential", "efficient equipment", "elasticity of demand", "electric generating capacity", "electric motors", "electric power", "electric power sector", "electricity", "electricity capacity", "electricity consumption", "electricity costs", "electricity demand", "electricity distribution", "electricity efficiency", "electricity generation", "electricity generation capacity", "electricity generation mix", "electricity markets", "electricity production", "electricity sales", "electricity savings", "electricity sector", "electricity supply", "electricity tariff", "electricity tariffs", "electricity use", "electrification", "emission", "emission reduction", "emission reduction targets", "emissions", "emissions from electricity generation", "energy demand", "energy efficiency", "energy efficiency improvements", "energy management", "energy market", "energy mix", "energy outlook", "energy planning", "energy policies", "energy pricing", "energy requirements", "energy resources", "energy security", "energy service", "energy service company", "energy sources", "energy use", "environmental benefits", "environmental goals", "environmental impact", "environmental implications", "environmental issues", "environmental outcomes", "environmental policies", "environmental regulations", "environmental sustainability", "financial burden", "financial crisis", "fossil", "fossil fuel", "fossil fuels", "framework convention on climate change", "fuel", "fuel for electricity generation", "fuel oil", "fuel price", "fuel prices", "fuel type", "gas development", "gas plants", "gas turbines", "gas usage", "generating capacity", "generation", "geothermal energy", "geothermal resources", "ghg", "global environment", "global environment facility", "greenhouse", "greenhouse gas", "greenhouse gas emissions", "gross domestic product", "growth in electricity demand", "hot water", "human health", "hydro sources", "hydroelectric plants", "hydroelectric potential", "hydrology", "hydropower", "hydropower generation", "imports", "income", "low-carbon", "member states", "monetary fund", "natural gas", "natural gas capacity", "natural gas generation", "natural gas plants", "natural gas resources", "nuclear energy", "nuclear power", "oil prices", "oil products", "petroleum", "petroleum products", "petroleum use", "photovoltaic systems", "policy makers", "power capacity", "power demand", "power generating capacity", "power generation", "power generation capacity", "power generation technologies", "power plants", "power production", "power production capacity", "power sector", "power sector planning", "power sectors", "power supply", "price volatility", "primary fuel", "production of electricity", "public utilities", "regulatory framework", "regulatory policies", "renewable electricity", "renewable energy", "renewable energy potential", "renewable energy resources", "renewable energy source", "renewable energy sources", "renewable energy technologies", "renewable sources", "renewable technologies", "rural electrification", "scenarios", "solar collectors", "source of electricity", "sugarcane", "supply costs", "supply of electricity", "sustainable development", "tax credits", "thermal power", "total electricity generation", "transmission grid", "transmission infrastructure", "transmission lines", "volatile prices", "wind", "wind resources", "world energy", "world energy outlook"], "pubtype": ["Directions in Development ;

After years of stagnation, economic growth has spurted gross domestic product (GDP) grew from an annual average rate of less than 2 percent in 1978-95 to nearly 6 percent over 2003-08. Inflation is half its level of the mid-1990s. Private capital flows have risen to $50 billion, exceeding foreign aid. Exports are growing, as is private sector activity. The number of democratic regimes has risen and the security situation has improved. The poverty rate is falling by 1 percentage point a year. Countries such as Ethiopia, Ghana, Mauritania, and Rwanda are on track to reach many of the millennium development goals. Nine African countries have achieved or are on track to achieve the target for extreme poverty. Among other encouraging trends are more fair and effective leadership, an improving business climate, increasing innovation, a more involved citizenry, and growing reliance on home-grown solutions. More and more, Africans are driving African development. This increased dynamism in Sub-Saharan Africa is evident across a broad swath of countries. It has created optimism that Africa's favorable development performance will be long lasting and that it could dramatically transform countries in the region. Along the way, the prevailing discourse on Africa's economic development has shifted from whether the region will develop to how the region is developing.

The intention is neither to advocate decentralization in general or in any particular form, nor to presume or privilege any particular decentralization objective. Instead, the purpose is to document the potential value of better understanding how (primarily national and intergovernmental) political and institutional dynamics do or could affect the scope for realizing decentralization reforms aligned with commonly advocated service delivery, governance, and poverty reduction goals. The underlying premise is that systematic analysis of these issues can productively complement the dominantly technical diagnostic work typically carried out by development partners. Specifically, development partners can benefit from better understanding the practical significance of motives that drive politicians and bureaucrats to support or oppose reform at various stages of the decentralization process, from making an initial reform decision to detailed design and implementation. In addition, the framework addresses how these incentives can weaken, strengthen, or shift in response to changes in political and economic conditions that arise after reform begins. A general approach to conducting political economy of decentralization analysis is outlined, recognizing the need to tailor such analysis to the particular country context.

It looks at four sectors: construction, land transport, legal services, and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) services. The intent is to stimulate dialogue on trade in services between decision-makers in CEFTA countries. In CEFTA economies, export of services accounts for about 10 percent of GDP in non coastal countries and much more in coastal countries, where foreign currency earnings from tourism are the dominant form of service = exports. Though CEFTA countries have opened their markets considerably, mostly because they are pursuing accession to the European Union (EU) and the World Trade Organization (WTO), there are still obstacles to trade in services. Some, such as the movement of professional workers, are general; others are sector-specific. In what follows, the next section illustrates the importance of the services sectors in CEFTA economies and analyzes trends in services trade and in intraregional trade for countries that have such data available. The third section describes general barriers to trade in services, and specific barriers for the four sectors specified. The analysis reviews the legal and institutional framework for trade in services and features assessments by regional companies that export such services.

Equally, the emerging impacts of global warming on natural disasters and on agriculture are warning signs of the urgency to care for the environment and society. Recent global experience in the financial and environmental arenas demonstrates clearly the need to put in place and enforce regulatory frameworks that balance costs and benefits, both private and social. In this context, the crucial questions in the recent evaluation by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) of the World Bank Group's safeguards and sustainability policy framework concern the effectiveness of the instrument in mitigating adverse environmental and social impacts of development programs, and suggesting ways to improve the results. IEG's evaluation covered projects approved from FY1999 to FY2008. During this period, social and environmental effects were significant in half of World Bank projects 1,402 with commitments of $109 billion; 88 percent of projects financed by the International Finance Corporation (IFC)  1,662 with commitments of $35 billion; and 217 guarantees by the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). The main thrust of the evaluation findings is that the World Bank Group's safeguards and sustainability policies have helped avoid or mitigate large-scale social and environmental risks in the projects it financed, but many projects with substantial environmental and social impacts remain of concern primarily because of inadequate supervision and follow-up.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2339", "subjectTags": ["abatement", "access to information", "accountabilities", "accountability", "adb", "adequate disclosure", "advisory services", "agricultural sectors", "allocative efficiency", "bank lending", "bank management", "benefit analysis", "borrower", "borrowing", "capacity building", "civil society", "climate change", "comparative analysis", "complaints", "conflict of interest", "conflicts of interest", "cost analysis", "cost effectiveness", "cost savings", "crises", "current costs", "development assistance", "development bank", "development effectiveness", "displacement", "division of labor", "economic growth", "eib", "empirical evidence", "environmental", "environmental impacts", "environmental management", "environmental performance", "environmental policies", "environmental sustainability", "equities", "equity investments", "exclusion", "expenditure", "externalities", "financial institutions", "financial intermediaries", "financial intermediary", "gender", "government expenditures", "guarantee agency", "income", "indigenous peoples", "inflation", "institutional capacity", "institutional reforms", "international finance", "international law", "international laws", "investment bank", "laws", "legislation", "lending policies", "lending portfolio", "living standards", "moral hazard", "multilateral development banks", "negative externalities", "ombudsman", "peer review", "pollution", "poor client", "private investments", "private sector financing", "real sector", "refugees", "remedy", "reorganization", "resource allocation", "resource management", "resource use", "safety", "savings", "social benefits", "social costs", "social development", "structural adjustment", "supply chain", "supply chains", "sustainable development", "technical support", "transport", "working conditions"], "pubtype": ["Evaluation Brief ; No. 15"], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2339/636830PUB00WB000Box0361524B0PUBLIC0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2339/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2339", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:04:23Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2414": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2414/530960PUB0Egyp101Official0Use0Only1.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2414/530960PUB0Egyp101Official0Use0Only1.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Egyptian Women Workers and Entrepreneurs : Maximizing Opportunities in the Economic Sphere", "abstract": "Women are a powerful force for sustainable economic growth. A growing body of microeconomic empirical evidence and emerging macroeconomic analysis shows that gender inequality limits economic growth in developing economies. Research also shows that considerable potential for economic growth could be realized if countries support women's full economic participation. Increases in women's income tend to correlate with greater expenditure on family welfare and children, because women often spend a greater share of their income on their children's nutrition, health care, and education. From an economic perspective, removing gender biases and maintaining a level playing field reduces possible market distortions or malfunctioning. Moreover, promoting women's participation in business may bolster women's overall participation in the labor market, because women-owned businesses are more likely to employ other women. This report analyzes the main reasons for this disparity in the Arab Republic of Egypt and proposes solutions to level the playing field and enable women's full economic contributions. The Investment Climate Survey (ICS) of 1,156 enterprises from the manufacturing sector was carried out in October 2008, using the World Bank standard methodology. The recall questionnaire of 566 enterprises was conducted in October 2008. The gender workers module was conducted in August 2005. It sampled about 15 full-time workers from each firm covered by the ICS recall survey. About 70 percent of the ICS sample is made up of small and medium firms, about 85 percent of which are owned by individuals or families. Large firms employing more than 150 workers account for about 30 percent of the sample. In about 35 percent of the sample, a woman is a main shareholder; in 15 percent of these firms, women own the majority of the firm.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2414", "subjectTags": ["absence of women", "access to finance", "access to land", "access to markets", "access to training", "bank account", "banking system", "banks", "barriers to women", "breadwinner", "breadwinners", "business associations", "business education", "business management", "business owner", "business success", "business women", "businesswomen", "capacity building", "capital requirement", "capital stock", "chamber of commerce", "checking accounts", "child care", "collateral", "collateral requirements", "compensation", "corruption", "courts", "credit information", "credit information systems", "credit provision", "cultural norms", "custody", "custom", "daycare", "demographic characteristics", "deposit", "discrimination", "discrimination against women", "discriminatory practices", "divorce", "dominance", "e-learning", "earnings", "economic activities", "economic activity", "economic contribution", "economic contributions", "economic crisis", "economic empowerment", "economic growth", "economic opportunities", "economic reforms", "economic resources", "educated women", "educational attainment", "employer", "employers", "employment growth", "employment of women", "empowerment of women", "enterprise development", "entrepreneurs", "equal opportunity", "equal pay", "equality of opportunity", "equitable access", "equity capital", "expenditure", "expenditures", "families", "family court", "family income", "family obligations", "family responsibilities", "family welfare", "female", "female education", "female employees", "female employment", "female enterprises", "female entrepreneurs", "female entrepreneurship", "female labor", "female labor force", "female labor force participation", "female respondents", "female workers", "females", "finance access", "financial development", "financial exclusion", "financial institutions", "financial intermediaries", "financial sector reform", "financial services", "foreign firms", "formal economy", "forms of discrimination", "gender", "gender action", "gender barriers", "gender biases", "gender characteristics", "gender composition", "gender differences", "gender dimension", "gender disparities", "gender equality", "gender equity", "gender gap", "gender gaps", "gender inequalities", "gender inequality", "gender mainstreaming", "gender segregation", "gender specialist", "girls", "greater access", "groups of women", "home", "household chores", "households", "human capital", "human rights", "husband", "immigration", "income-generating activities", "informal sector", "informal workers", "international bank", "investment plans", "job security", "judge", "key challenge", "labor force", "labor force participation", "labor force surveys", "labor law", "labor market", "labor markets", "lack of access", "laws", "legal status", "legislation", "limited access", "loan", "loan application", "loan application procedures", "loan-to-deposit ratio", "mainstreaming gender", "market economy", "married male", "married women", "maternity benefits", "maternity leave", "micro-enterprises", "microcredit", "microfinance", "national council for women", "needs of women", "nutrition", "open market", "opportunities for women", "participation of women", "peace", "perceptions of gender", "perceptions of women", "poor women", "prejudice", "private credit", "private investment", "private sector banks", "privatization", "productivity", "professional women", "profitability", "proportion of women", "provision of credit", "provision of finance", "regulatory environment for women", "representation of women", "reserve requirements", "role of women", "rural women", "safety nets", "savings", "savings accounts", "sex", "sex segregation", "single woman", "single women", "small enterprise", "small enterprises", "social change", "social fund", "social insurance", "start-up", "trade unions", "undp", "unemployed women", "unemployment", "union", "united nations", "united nations development programme", "unmarried women", "unskilled women", "unskilled workers", "urban areas", "urban development", "wage gap", "wife", "will", "wives", "woman", "women employees", "women entrepreneurs", "women in business", "women in society", "women managers", "women workers", "working capital", "working women"], "pubtype": ["Directions in Development ;

Regulatory Considerations", "abstract": "This book is a compilation of two recently completed works on the convergence of information and communication technology (ICT) (Singh and Raja 2008, 2009). Since then, convergence, the eroding of boundaries among previously separate ICT services, networks, and business practices, has accelerated and deepened. At the time these reports were written, convergence was already a reality and was picking up pace in low-income countries, as in the rest of the world. Now, as this introduction summarizes, broadband networks are reaching deeper into previously unserved areas. The growing number of people connected to broadband networks are consuming, sharing, and creating new multimedia content and applications. And they are doing this on handheld and portable devices that are less costly and do more than before. All sorts of users, governments, businesses, individuals, and ICT firms, are looking to cut costs while capturing greater value. Taken together, these trends indicate that convergence is set to accelerate even through the ongoing global economic downturn. Countries that enable convergence through appropriate policy and regulatory responses will realize significant benefits in terms of expanded access, lower prices, and greater competition. Chapter two of this book focuses on the strategic implications of convergence and possible policy responses. Chapter three focuses on emerging regulatory practices facilitating multiple plays, or the provision of multiple services, such as voice telephony, broadcasting, and Internet access, by one operator over a single communications network, typically telephone or cable television but increasingly mobile and fixed wireless networks. The book concludes by presenting several best-practice principles for regulatory responses to multiple plays and, to some extent, to convergence more generally. Indeed, the main task for regulators is to remove artificial barriers and restrictions that are remnants of legacy regulation, thus clearing the way for market forces to play out, promoting the public interest, and leading to the realization of a range of benefits for users.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2417", "subjectTags": ["3g", "access to services", "auctions", "backbone", "bandwidth",

for Developing Countries", "abstract": "Governments in developing countries have been increasingly involved in the support of commercial agricultural (crop and livestock) insurance programs in recent years. A striking example is China, where, with support (and premium subsidies) from the central and provincial governments, the agricultural insurance market grew dramatically to become the second largest market in the world (after the United States) in 2008. In India and Mexico, weather-based crop insurance has been developed on a large scale to protect farmers against the vagaries of the weather. Many other countries have investigated the feasibility of agricultural insurance, and some have implemented pilot programs. This book aims to inform and update public and private decision makers involved in promoting agricultural insurance about recent developments in agriculture insurance. The literature is heavily biased toward the practice and experience of a few very large public-private programs in Northern America and Europe, which are driven by large public financial subsidies. This book provides decision makers with a framework for developing agricultural insurance. It is based on an analytical review of the rationale for public intervention in agricultural insurance and a detailed comparative analysis of crop and livestock insurance programs provided with and without government support in more than 65 developed and developing countries. The comparative analysis is based on a survey conducted by the World Bank's agricultural insurance team in 2008. Drawing on the survey results, the book identifies some key roles governments can play to support the development of sustainable, affordable, and cost-effective agricultural insurance programs.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2432", "subjectTags": ["accident", "accidents", "agricultural economics", "agricultural insurance", "agricultural insurance scheme", "agricultural insurance schemes", "agricultural production", "asymmetric information", "banks", "basis risk", "beneficiaries", "bonds", "brokers", "capital markets", "catastrophe risk financing", "catastrophic events", "catastrophic insurance", "catastrophic risks", "climate", "climate change", "coinsurance", "commercial insurance", "contingent liability", "cooperatives", "cost of capital", "cost of insurance", "costs of insurance", "credit insurance", "crop insurance", "crop insurance premium", "crop insurance program", "crop insurance scheme", "development network", "disaster", "disaster risk", "disasters", "donor community", "drought", "droughts", "earthquake", "earthquakes", "economic analysis", "economic costs", "economic growth", "economic models", "economic welfare", "environmental policy", "exchange rates", "extreme events", "extreme weather", "extreme weather events", "farmer", "feasibility", "financial challenges", "financial compensation", "financial institutions", "financial loss", "financial management", "financial markets", "financial mechanism", "financial mechanisms", "financial performance", "financial risk", "financial risk management", "financial services", "financial support", "fire", "flood", "floods", "futures", "general insurance", "gross national income", "health care", "health risk", "housing", "hurricane", "hurricanes", "income", "indemnities", "indemnity", "indemnity insurance", "insurability", "insurable interest", "insurance agents", "insurance broker", "insurance brokers", "insurance companies", "insurance company", "insurance contract", "insurance contracts", "insurance coverage", "insurance culture", "insurance experts", "insurance guarantee", "insurance market", "insurance markets", "insurance policy", "insurance pools", "insurance premium", "insurance premium rates", "insurance premiums", "insurance product", "insurance products", "insurance schemes", "insurance sector", "insurance solutions", "insurers", "interest rates", "international financial institutions", "international financial organizations", "international reinsurance", "liberalization", "life insurance", "life insurance premiums", "livestock insurance", "loss ratio", "market failure", "moral hazard", "multiple peril crop insurance", "natural disaster", "natural disasters", "non-bank", "non??life insurance", "outbreaks", "policy makers", "portfolio", "price risk", "price volatility", "primary insurer", "private insurance", "private insurance companies", "programs", "property insurance", "public insurance", "rates", "re insurance", "reducing poverty", "regulatory framework", "reinsurance agreement", "reinsurance capacity", "reinsurance companies", "reinsurance contract", "reinsurance markets", "reinsurer", "reinsurers", "relief", "reserves", "risk assessment", "risk aversion", "risk exposure", "risk management", "risk management policies", "risk mitigation", "risk profiles", "risk reduction", "risk transfer", "safety", "savings", "social assistance", "solvency", "storm", "subsistence farmers", "sustainability", "total cost", "transactions costs", "treaty reinsurance", "uncertainties", "underwriting", "weather insurance"], "pubtype": [], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2432/538810PUB0Gove101Official0Use0Only1.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2432/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2432", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:33:26Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2431": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2431/538800PUB0AFR0101Official0Use0Only1.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2431/538800PUB0AFR0101Official0Use0Only1.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Africa Development Indicators 2010 : Silent and Lethal,  How Quiet Corruption Undermines Africa's Development", "abstract": "The corruption that often captures newspaper headlines and provokes worldwide public disapproval is dominated by loud 'big-time corruption,' notably administrative and political corruption at the highest government levels. In response to this notoriety, the bulk of anti-corruption measures have been tailored to address this type of corruption. However, recent examinations of the level and quality of service delivery in developing countries, including the World Development Report 2004, have highlighted the need to expand the scope of the standard definition of corruption, the abuse of public office for private gain. While acknowledging the importance of big-time corruption in reducing funding for service delivery, recent research has devoted increasing attention to identifying corrupt practices downstream at the frontline of public service provision. Given the complexity of the task, the fight against quiet corruption requires tailoring policies to country circumstances, recognizing that priorities and responses may vary depending on different country conditions. This essay outlines a research agenda to identify interventions to address quiet corruption. Experimenting with various ways to empower beneficiaries and continuing the ongoing efforts to tackle big-time corruption will go a long way toward achieving this goal. Indeed, although combating loud and visible forms of corruption is necessary, fighting quiet corruption is critical if governments want to reduce poverty and promote sustainable growth.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2431", "subjectTags": ["abuse", "accountability", "antenatal care", "anti-corruption", "anticorruption", "arsenic", "asymmetric information", "balance of payments", "basic needs", "benchmarks", "beneficiaries", "bribery", "bribery scandals", "bribes", "businessmen", "capital formation", "certification", "civil servants", "clinics", "cohort studies", "collapse", "collusion", "communications technologies", "corrupt", "corrupt practices", "corruption", "corruption acts", "corruption cost", "counterfeit drugs", "debt", "debt relief", "delivery systems", "developed countries", "development goals", "discretion", "drugs", "economic development", "economic growth", "educational attainment", "emissions", "empirical evidence", "environmental", "families", "farms", "fight against corruption", "fraud", "good governance", "government officials", "grand corruption", "health care", "health care workers", "health outcomes", "health services", "heavy metals", "hospitals", "immunization", "income", "institutionalization", "integrity", "intervention", "iron", "justice", "labor force", "laboratories", "laws", "leadership", "learning", "lobbying", "market power", "medical treatment", "medication", "medicines", "migration", "monopoly", "morbidity", "mortality", "national income", "nurses", "nutrition", "operating costs", "packaging", "patient", "patients", "patronage", "penalties", "penalty", "perception of corruption", "petty corruption", "pharmaceutical", "pharmaceutical quality", "pharmaceuticals", "physicians", "police", "policy makers", "political corruption", "political economy", "politicians", "poor health", "poverty reduction", "price differences", "price indexes", "primary schools", "private gain", "producers", "public health", "public officials", "purchasing", "purchasing power", "quality assurance", "quality of services", "quality standards", "research agenda", "sanctions", "service delivery", "service utilization", "sustainable growth", "theft", "thefts", "transparency", "transport costs", "unemployment", "user fees", "victims", "wages", "workers", "working conditions"], "pubtype": ["Africa Development Indicators 2010"], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2431/538800PUB0AFR0101Official0Use0Only1.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2431/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2431", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:33:24Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2416": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2416/530950PUB0metr101Official0Use0Only1.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2416/530950PUB0metr101Official0Use0Only1.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Private Sector Participation in Light Rail-Light Metro Transit Initiatives", "abstract": "This book aims to help governments and public authorities to establish effective light rail-light metro transit (LRMT) systems, and focuses on use of Public-Private Participation (PPP) arrangements. Rather than identify a single approach, authors present options and discuss practical issues related to preparing and implementing new LRMT PPP schemes. The approach is focused on providing information that can be used to make informed decisions, adapted to local policy and objectives. The material presented is intended as a practical guide to developing LRMT PPPs in both developed and developing countries. This work endeavors to provide answers to readers' questions regarding how to successfully incorporate private sector participation in LRMT with a lesser emphasis on why LRMT and the private sector may be beneficial. The primary focus of this text is guiding the reader from design through to project implementation. It starts from the premise that underlying transport policy decisions will have already been made and that LRMT has already been identified as the appropriate transport solution. The authors have included some limited discussion of policy and technical issues where these directly impact the LRMT PPP approach. The approach is presented in nine sections, and in preparing it the author drew on current international LRMT PPP experience, through a series of interviews and case studies. The sections covered are: 1) urban transport and LRMT: an overview of urban transport policy, the characteristics of LRMT schemes and the influences on LRMT policies; 2) technical issues: a brief review of some key technical issues inherent in LRMT schemes and their potential impact on PPP design and implementation; 3) incorporating private sector participation in LRMT initiatives: what PPP has to offer, and an overview of the issues and stages public authorities follow to establish successful LRMT PPP arrangements; 4) understanding and managing risk: analyzing and allocating risks and responsibilities among stakeholders in the LRMT scheme and practical ways of designing risk allocation rules; 5) PPP, design, specifications and performance management: setting service standards and specifications and establishing associated costs; developing of performance and payment indicators and managing compliance; 6) funding and finance: large LRMT capital and system maintenance requirements require strong financing arrangements. The practical use of public and private financing mechanisms under PPP arrangement is reviewed; 7) developing a PPP agreement: looking at the main types of PPP agreements, an outline framework for developing the contractual arrangement is developed through re-view of key issues; 8) procurement: reviewing the approaches that the public authority can use to select the private partner; and 9)

Four million rural residents and another 12 million in small urban areas lie outside the reach of the Permanent Household Survey (EPH), which is the basis for poverty figures and most data on social conditions in the country. According to the best estimate, roughly a third of rural residents, more than a million people, live in poverty. The urban bias common too many countries have been accentuated by the lack of data on the rural poor. With little information on their condition, it is exceedingly difficult for policy makers to design policies and programs to help move people out of poverty. The report is organized as follows: chapter one profiles rural poverty base on the limited existing data, including the first in-depth analysis of rural poverty ever conducted with the 2001 population census. Chapter two presents findings from the new qualitative study of the rural poor conducted in the first half of 2007. Finally, chapter three concludes with a discussion of methodology for rural poverty analysis, focusing on the issues related to expanding the EPH to full national coverage.", "uri":

Health Workforce Study", "abstract": "Indonesia has made improving the access to health workers, especially in rural areas, and improving the quality of health provider's key priority areas of its next five-year development plan. Significant steps and policy changes were taken to improve the distribution of the health workforce, in particular the contracted doctors program and later the contracted midwives program, but few studies have been undertaken to measure the actual impact of these policies and programs. This book is part of the inputs prepared at the request of the government of Indonesia's national development agency, Bappenas, to inform the development of the next national development plan 2010-14. Other inputs include reports on health financing, fiscal space for health, health public expenditure review, and assessments of maternal health and pharmaceuticals. Study findings highlight the importance not only of improving the supply of health care, but also of improving quality, so as to improve health outcomes. Over the period studied, important gains in the determinants of health outcomes have occurred in Indonesia. At the same time, however, the study shows that Indonesia, despite the significant gains, continues to suffer from serious challenges in the number and distribution, and in particular the quality, of its health workers.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2434", "subjectTags": ["access to health services", "aging", "allocative efficiency", "burden of disease", "catastrophic expenditures", "center for health", "certification", "child care", "child mortality", "child mortality rate", "child mortality rates", "child nutrition", "child survival", "choice of provider", "choice of providers", "chronic disease", "clinics", "communicable diseases", "community health", "competencies", "deaths", "demand for services", "demographic changes", "demographic transition", "developing countries", "development planning", "dissemination", "doctors", "emergency obstetric care", "employment", "epidemiological transition", "equitable access", "essential medicines", "existing resources", "expenditures", "family planning", "fees for services", "fertility", "fertility rates", "financial control", "financial protection", "financial risk", "general practitioners", "government policies", "gross domestic product", "gross national income", "health care", "health care demand", "health care facilities", "health care provider", "health care providers", "health care provision", "health care sector", "health care services", "health care workers", "health centers", "health education", "health expenditures", "health facilities", "health financing", "health indicators", "health insurance", "health insurance program", "health insurance scheme", "health interventions", "health manpower", "health outcomes", "health policy", "health posts", "health professionals", "health programs", "health promotion", "health providers", "health reform", "health research", "health sector", "health sector reform", "health service", "health service delivery", "health service management", "health service providers", "health services", "health specialist", "health status", "health strategy", "health system", "health system performance", "health workforce", "hiv/aids", "hospital", "hospital beds", "hospitals", "human development", "human resources", "human resources development", "illness", "immunization", "immunizations", "important policy", "incentive schemes", "income", "indexes", "inequitable distribution", "inequities", "infant", "infant mortality", "infant mortality rate", "influenza", "injuries", "inpatient care", "institutional capacity", "insurance schemes", "international comparisons", "labor market", "laws", "legal status", "life expectancy", "live births", "local capacity", "local communities", "local governments", "low-income countries", "material resources", "maternal health", "maternal mortality", "maternal mortality rate", "maternal mortality rates", "maternal mortality ratio", "measles", "medical care", "medical doctors", "medical education", "medical personnel", "medical school", "medicines", "midwife", "midwifery", "midwives", "millennium development goal", "ministry of health", "mortality", "national development", "national development plan", "national family planning", "nurse", "nurses", "nursing", "obesity", "outpatient care", "outpatient services", "paramedics", "patient", "patients", "physician", "physicians", "policy change", "policy makers", "policy research", "policy-making process", "polio", "population sector", "population size", "populous country", "pregnant women", "prenatal care", "primary care", "primary health care", "private health services", "private sector", "private services", "probability", "professional associations", "progress", "provider payment", "provision of care", "provision of health services", "provision of services", "public expenditure", "public health", "public health interventions", "public health personnel", "public health services", "public hospitals", "public sector", "public service", "public services", "quality assurance", "quality of care", "quality of education", "quality of health", "quality of health care", "quality of services", "quality services", "research program", "respect", "risk factors", "rural areas", "school quality", "secondary schools", "short supply", "smoking", "socioeconomic status", "supply of health care", "tetanus", "treatment services", "tuberculosis", "universal health insurance coverage", "urban areas", "use of health services", "vaccines", "village health workers", "work force", "workers"], "pubtype": ["Directions in Development ;

The framework sets guidelines and should not be seen as a constitution; nothing in the framework overrides any specific standard. The objective of financial statements is to provide information about the financial position (statement of financial position), performance (statement of comprehensive income), and changes in financial position (statement of cash flows) of an entity that is useful to a wide range of users in making economic decisions. Users of financial information include present and potential capital providers, employees, lenders, suppliers, customers, and the government.

The objective is to provide a diagnostic of how the three excluded groups under analysis have fared along various development indicators during a period of rapid economic growth in the national economy. In seeking this objective, the report also addresses correlates and the processes that explain how and why these groups have fared the way they have over a period of time. Chapter two in this report focuses on the Adivasis or STs. In most analyses, this topic is addressed after the Dalits, but the author has placed it first for analytical and organizational purposes. There are two reasons for this: tribal groups are not strictly within the caste system, and the bonds of rituals do not affect their relations with the world in general. Also the report shows that outcomes among Adivasis are among the worst, despite considerable variation across places of residence and tribal groupings. Finally, Chapter three focuses on Dalits, a term that has united the SCs in a process that is more empowering than the process of identification by individual names, which have been and continue to be associated with ritually impure occupations.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2289", "subjectTags": ["abortion", "access to credit", "access to health care", "access to health services", "access

Central Asia", "abstract": "Before the onset of the global financial crisis in late 2008, countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia (ECA) experienced strong economic growth. Demand for electricity increased steadily with gross domestic product (GDP). GDP grew, on average, 6.5 percent between 2000 and 2007, and electricity consumption per capita grew 2.75 percent. Meanwhile, energy security and supply reliability were a growing concern for policymakers and planners. Despite increased access to financing through the opening of international financial markets, under-maintenance of old soviet-era power sector infrastructure created a backlog of critical investments threatening the stability of the sector. As a result, a gap between demand and available supply capacity was beginning to emerge. This report analyzes the impacts of the financial crisis on power sectors in the ECA region through the experience of five countries (the study countries); Armenia, the Kyrgyz Republic, Romania, Serbia, and Ukraine. The report's objective is to help policymakers in the region plan and prioritize electricity sector investments in the wake of the financial crisis, and to provide a basis for future discussions about World Bank assistance.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2284", "subjectTags": ["access to financing", "advisory service", "affordability", "approach", "approval process", "arrears", "availability", "balance", "bank debt", "bank financing", "bank loan", "bank loans", "barriers to investment", "bids", "bonds", "borrowing", "borrowing capacities", "budget deficit", "budget deficits", "capital constraints", "capital requirements", "central bank", "chemical industries", "coal", "coal mines", "coal mining", "coal production", "collateral", "collateral requirements", "combustion", "commercial bank", "commercial bank lending", "commercial banks", "commercial lenders", "commercial lending", "consumption of energy", "copyright clearance", "copyright clearance center", "cost of electricity", "credibility", "credit growth", "credit guarantee", "credit guarantees", "credit risk", "currency", "currency depreciation", "currency depreciations", "debt levels", "debt payment", "debt service", "default ratings", "demand for electricity", "demand forecast", "deposits", "developing countries", "development bank", "economic crisis", "economic development", "economic growth", "electricity", "electricity consumption", "electricity demand", "electricity producers", "electricity tariff", "emission", "emission reduction", "employment", "energy consumption", "energy demand", "energy efficiency", "energy efficiency investments", "energy outlook", "energy shortage", "energy shortages", "energy supply", "enforcement of contracts", "equipment", "equity capital", "equity financing", "equity investments", "equity investors", "exchange rates", "expenditure", "expenditures", "financial covenants", "financial crisis", "financial health", "financial performance", "financing costs", "financing needs", "fiscal constraints", "fixed costs", "foreign currency", "foreign currency debt", "foreign equity", "foreign investors", "fuel", "fuel consumption", "fuel costs", "fuel prices", "gap financing", "gas", "gas prices", "generating capacity", "generation", "generation capacity", "governance indicators", "government budget", "government budget deficits", "government policy", "gross domestic product", "heat", "heat tariff", "high electricity demand", "higher gas", "holding", "hydropower", "hydropower plant", "interest rates", "international bank", "international finance", "international financial institution", "international financial institutions", "international financial markets", "investing", "investment bank", "investment climate", "investment in energy efficiency", "investment plans", "investment strategy", "kilowatt hour", "lack of transparency", "large power plants", "legal obligation", "lenders", "lending conditions", "lending requirements", "line of credit", "liquidity", "loan agreement", "local currencies", "local currency", "long-term interest", "long-term interest rates", "long-term investments", "market prices", "market reforms", "market risk", "market risks", "market share", "market transactions", "maturities", "monetary fund", "natural gas", "natural gas prices", "new companies", "non-performing loans", "nuclear fuel", "nuclear power", "nuclear power plant", "oil", "operating cost", "operating costs", "partial credit", "partial risk", "payment obligations", "peak demand", "power", "power plant", "power sector", "power sectors", "price of coal", "private financing", "private investment", "private investments", "private investors", "private sector financing", "privatization", "profit margins", "profitability", "property rights", "protection measures", "public budgets", "public debt", "public spending", "recession", "regulatory frameworks", "reinvestment", "renewable energy", "renewable energy capacity", "renewable energy projects", "reserve", "reserves", "return", "return on assets", "return on investment", "shareholders", "short-term borrowings", "short-term debt", "sovereign debt", "strategic investors", "supply of financing", "sustainable investment", "tariff levels", "tax", "tax exemptions", "tax revenues", "technical assistance", "technical support", "thermal power", "thermal power plant", "thermal power plants", "trading", "transmission system", "treaty", "unemployment", "union", "utility company", "wind", "wind power", "wind power plants", "working capital"], "pubtype": ["Directions in Development ;

This book takes on an elusive yet frequently mentioned concept in development evaluation ECB. Differences and divergences were apparent in the spring of 2009, when the International Development Evaluation Association (IDEAS) held its biannual global assembly in Johannesburg, South Africa, around the theme of 'getting to results: evaluation capacity building and development.' What became apparent was that a number of challenges had already been identified, but that trying to capture lessons learned on effective strategies was difficult, because of the failure to agree upon a unique and coherent definition of ECB, its various objectives and wide scope, and the diversity of institutional contexts in which it takes place. This book brings together the key papers from that global assembly, as well as new papers that reflect on what was learned and shared at the conference.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2285", "subjectTags": ["accountability", "agriculture", "auditing", "best practices", "capabilities", "capacity building", "central bank", "central banks", "collection of data", "communication technology", "comparative analysis", "comparative economics", "copyright", "corrective measures", "data collection", "data processing", "decision making", "development agency", "development assistance", "development planning", "development policy", "development projects", "development strategy", "e-mail", "economic development", "economic growth", "enabling environment", "evaluation activities", "evaluation associations", "evaluation capacity", "evaluation results", "evaluators", "expenditures", "financial crisis", "financial management", "financial resources", "financial sector", "food security", "gdp", "girls' education", "gross domestic product", "human capital", "human resource", "human resources", "id", "impact assessment", "impact evaluations", "implementing agency", "infant mortality", "information flows", "information system", "information systems", "information technology", "institution", "institutional framework", "institutional frameworks", "integration", "interest rate", "interface", "intervening factors", "intervention", "interventions", "inventory", "knowledge management", "learning", "legal framework", "licenses", "m&e activities", "m&e capacity", "m&e policy", "m&e results", "m&e systems", "m&e tools", "macroeconomic performance", "macroeconomic policy", "macroeconomic stability", "management system", "management systems", "material", "monetary policies", "monetary policy", "monitoring data", "national income", "natural resources", "networks", "newsletter", "ngo", "per capita income", "performance indicators", "periodic surveys", "physical progress", "policy changes", "policy formulation", "policy framework", "political economy", "private sector", "probability", "procurement", "program evaluation", "programs", "project evaluation", "project management", "project monitoring", "public administration", "public policies", "quality management", "queries", "real gdp", "reducing poverty", "result", "results", "retention", "role of institutions", "search", "search engine", "social development", "social indicators", "software systems", "supervision", "sustainable development", "targeting", "targets", "technical department", "technical knowledge", "telephone", "training programs", "transaction", "transactions costs", "transparency", "unemployment", "users", "uses", "value chain", "virtual community", "voters", "wealth", "web", "web site", "www"], "pubtype": [], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2285/608080PUB0Infl10Box358332B01PUBLIC1.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2285/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2285", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:03:14Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2286": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2286/608060PUB0Conn10Box358332B01PUBLIC1.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2286/608060PUB0Conn10Box358332B01PUBLIC1.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Connecting Landlocked Developing Countries to Markets : Trade Corridors in the 21st Century", "abstract": "The importance of transport corridors for trade and development, including for some of the poorest countries in the world, is widely recognized in this book. A new consensus has also emerged that reducing trade costs and improving access to corridors is not just a matter of building infrastructure. The policies that regulate transport services providers and the movement of goods along corridors are important determinants of the social rate of return on such infrastructure investment. This book avoids optimistic assumptions regarding the prospects for new high-level agreements and decisions to facilitate transit or the possible benefits from increased use of technology. Instead, the authors argue that much can be done through the implementation of readily available existing tools. The use of these tools is often hampered by not only capacity constraints; but, equally if not more important, a lack of commitment. Political economic factors in both the landlocked countries and their transit neighbors must be recognized and addressed. This book offers examples of possible implementation strategies that, while challenging, should in principle help in overcoming these political economic constraints. The main message is that to bring about efficient trade corridors governments and stakeholders should focus on properly implementing the fiscal, regulatory, and procedural principles for international transit that encourage quality-driven logistics services. The various implementation challenges are the primary focus of this book.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2286", "subjectTags": ["adb", "adverse effects", "aim", "air", "air freight", "air transport", "alternative transport", "alternative transport modes", "average transit time", "benchmarks", "bilateral trade", "border crossing", "border crossings", "border management", "bottlenecks", "boxes", "bridge", "cargo", "carriage", "carriers", "cif", "commodities", "commodity", "community transport", "competitiveness", "congestion", "container services", "containers", "cost of transportation", "costs of transportation", "customs", "customs brokers", "customs clearance", "customs duties", "deliveries", "delivery times", "demurrage", "development assistance", "development policy", "diesel", "diesel fuel", "drivers", "economic conditions", "economic constraints", "economic cooperation", "economic integration", "economic performance", "efficient transport", "exports", "feasibility studies", "financial crisis", "financial institutions", "forwarding", "freight", "freight bureaus", "freight costs", "freight forwarders", "freight movement", "freight service", "freight services", "freight traffic", "freight transport", "fuel consumption", "fuel shortages", "gatt", "handling", "highway", "highway corridor", "highway network", "highway project", "highway systems", "implementation strategies", "income levels", "inflation", "infrastructure capacity", "infrastructure costs", "infrastructure development", "infrastructure investment", "infrastructure projects", "infrastructures", "inland waterway", "inland waterway transport", "inland waterways", "inspection", "insurance", "international carriage of goods", "international trade", "international transit", "international transport", "international union of railways", "inventories", "inventory", "itc", "land transport", "landlocked countries", "ldcs", "leasing contracts", "legal framework", "legislation", "loading", "logistics costs", "long-distance", "manufacturing", "monopoly", "national transport", "natural resources", "optimization", "passengers", "penalties", "per capita income", "political economy", "port authority", "port of entry", "price differential", "productivity", "profit margins", "purchasing power", "quality of transport", "rail", "rail operators", "rail transit", "rail transport", "railroads", "railway", "regional development banks", "regional road transport", "regional transit", "resource mobilization", "risk management", "road", "road conditions", "road freight rates", "road infrastructure", "road investment", "road network", "road quality", "road transport", "road transport prices", "road transport services", "road use", "roads", "route", "routes", "seaports", "shipments", "shippers", "shipping", "subsidiary", "supply chains", "surcharges", "tax", "technical assistance", "toll", "tolls", "trade facilitation", "trade flows", "trade logistics", "trade performance", "trade volume", "traffic", "transit", "transit corridor", "transit corridors", "transit countries", "transit information", "transit infrastructure", "transit institutions", "transit policy", "transit system", "transit system performance", "transit systems", "transit times", "transit trade", "transit trip", "transport agencies", "transport agreement", "transport corridors", "transport costs", "transport facilitation", "transport industry", "transport infrastructure", "transport investment", "transport markets", "transport policies", "transport policy", "transport projects", "transport services", "transport strategies", "transportation", "transportation corridors", "transportation costs", "transports", "truck capacity", "truck traffic", "truck use", "trucks", "true", "vehicle", "vehicle operating", "vehicle operating costs", "vehicle regulations", "vehicles", "volume of traffic", "waiting time", "warehousing", "water navigation", "world trade organization", "wto"], "pubtype": ["Directions in Development ;

By early 2009, it was clear that this economic downturn would be more severe than any crisis since the great depression, prompting some to it as the 'great recession.' Eastern European and Central Asian countries were hit particularly hard during 2009, global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) contracted for the first time since Second World War. The financial crisis and the ensuing economic downturn, the worst since the Great Depression in the 1930s, went hand in hand with tightening of credit markets, bank failures, firm closures, and high demand for social safety nets. This report, The jobs crisis: household and Government responses to the great recession in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, brings together evidence that World Bank teams have collected on the impact of the crisis on households and families in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. This report shows how the crisis was felt by Eastern European and Central Asian households. Not only did unemployment rise sharply but it also lasted longer. The report also shows that the pain of the recession was broader, with workers taking home smaller paychecks as firms offered lower wage rates and fewer hours of work to their workers. The jobs crisis finds that households used a variety of ways to cope with the crisis. The jobs crisis presents an account of how governments reacted to the crisis through social policy reforms and initiatives and how such responses could be improved in the future. Unemployment insurance benefits played a particularly important cushioning role, but coverage of the unemployed tended to be limited.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2287", "subjectTags": ["accruals", "active labor", "active labor market", "active labor market program", "active labor market programs", "assistance programs", "automatic stabilizer", "bank failures", "beneficiaries", "borrowing", "budget deficits", "capital flows", "capital investments", "central governments", "child labor", "consolidation", "coping strategies", "country-specific factors", "covariate shocks", "credit markets", "debt", "development bank", "durable goods", "economic crises", "economic downturn", "economic downturns", "economic growth", "economic recovery", "education programs", "educational attainment", "educational services", "eligibility criteria", "employability", "employment growth", "employment offices", "employment prospects", "employment protection legislation", "employment reduction", "ethnic groups", "ethnic minorities", "family labor", "financial crises", "financial crisis", "financial markets", "firing costs", "fiscal constraints", "fiscal deficits", "fiscal discipline", "flexible labor markets", "food expenditures", "food security", "foreign labor", "government health", "gross domestic product", "gross wages", "health expenditures", "health insurance", "high employment", "high unemployment", "high unemployment rates", "household characteristics", "household enterprise", "household income", "household savings", "household surveys", "household wealth", "household welfare", "human capital", "human capital investments", "human development", "idiosyncratic shocks", "income losses", "income shocks", "income support", "inflation", "inflation rates", "inflexible labor", "informal credit", "informal safety nets", "informal sector", "informal transfers", "insurance program", "international bank", "job loss", "job losses", "job seekers", "job vacancy", "jobs", "jobs crises", "jobs crisis", "labor adjustment", "labor costs", "labor demand", "labor force", "labor force participation", "labor laws", "labor market", "labor market adjustment", "labor market conditions", "labor market policy", "labor market regulations", "labor markets", "labor programs", "labor regulations", "labor supply", "labor union", "labour", "layoff", "layoffs", "leave of absence", "local government", "local governments", "long-term unemployment", "low employment", "macroeconomic conditions", "macroeconomic crisis", "macroeconomic shocks", "manpower", "manpower policy", "manufacturing industries", "market economies", "market economy", "medical care", "medical insurance", "minimum income", "minimum wage", "ministries of finance", "mitigation strategies", "monetary fund", "moral hazard", "natural disasters", "new entrants", "nutritional status", "opportunity costs", "part-time employment", "passive labor", "passive labor market programs", "penalties", "pension", "pensions", "pocket expenses", "policy responses", "poor", "poverty reduction", "preventative health", "preventive care", "primary school", "private sector", "product market", "product markets", "profitability", "program design", "public employment", "public savings", "public spending", "public works", "public works programs", "real wage", "real wages", "recessions", "remittance", "remittances", "retirement", "safety", "safety net", "safety net programs", "safety nets", "savings", "self employment", "service sector", "severance pay", "shock", "skilled workers", "social assistance", "social benefits", "social fund", "social impacts", "social investment", "social policy", "social programs", "social protection", "social safety nets", "social security", "social transfers", "structural reforms", "structural unemployment", "subsidiary", "targeting", "temporary employment", "total employment", "total workers", "unemployed", "unemployed people", "unemployed workers", "unemployment", "unemployment benefits", "unemployment figures", "unemployment insurance", "unemployment insurance benefits", "unemployment office", "vulnerable groups", "vulnerable households", "wage bill", "wage levels", "wage rate", "wage rates", "wage subsidies", "wage subsidy", "wage subsidy programs", "wage workers", "war", "work experience", "worker", "workers", "working hours", "younger workers", "youth unemployment", "youth unemployment rate", "youth unemployment rates"], "pubtype": ["Directions in development ;

The book is organized into eleven chapters. Chapter one outlines the troubling financial market conditions at home and abroad before the crisis. Chapter two then delves into the origin of the crisis and offers analyses on the shortcomings of the Korean economy and the instability of the international financial system. In chapter three, policy measures the government executed in the wake of the onset of the crisis are described and analyzed. Chapter four probes the steps taken to reduce the risk of sovereign insolvency in the face of the cool market reaction to the initial package of crisis response measures announced by the International Monetary Fund in December 1997. Chapter five describes the background within which the government established the institutional framework necessary for corporate, financial, and labor market restructuring between December 1997 and April 1998. The government efforts to secure additional foreign currency liquidity through the markets and to devise initiatives to counter the massive unemployment are discussed in detail. In chapter six, the situation during May and June 1998 is explored with a focus on the closure of nonviable corporate and financial companies and the efforts to drive down interest rates and revive credit flows. This is followed, in chapter seven, by an analysis of the first phase of financial sector restructuring, which started in the third quarter of 1998, and the measures adopted to shore up potential growth and cope with the pressing problem of unemployment. Chapters eight and nine deal separately with the restructuring of the top five chaebols (the large family-controlled and family-run groups that dominate business in Korea), the economic stimulus packages applied during the fourth quarter of 1998, the efforts to restore financial market stability and economic growth, and the initial phase of foreign exchange liberalization measures, which were implemented during the first half of 1999. Chapter ten then discusses the situation during the second half of 1999, with a particular focus on the collapse of the Daewoo business group, including the steps taken to contain the resulting fallout, as well as measures aimed at expanding the economic recovery. Chapter eleven, the final chapter, offers a diagnosis of the Korean economy, along with an analysis of the policy implications and the responses for the future.", "uri":

It is a compilation of lecture notes used in face-to-face and e-learning courses presented by the World Bank Institute's (WBI) Poverty Program during 2004-08. The volume is divided into three parts. Part one discusses basic concepts and measurement issues pertaining to poverty, national income, and economic growth. Part two deals with the macroeconomic policies that are critical for economic growth in the short term. It covers government enforced fiscal and exchange-rate policies and the roles of financial institutions, development assistance (or aid), debt relief, and trade policies. Part three covers the structural and sectoral policies that affect longer-term economic growth and poverty reduction. To underscore the impact of good governance and effective service delivery in growth and poverty reduction, separate chapters are devoted to institutional and technological development, education, health, labor, and land. The volume ends with a chapter that summarizes knowledge of growth theory, reviews the process of growth in 13 successful countries, and draws out implications for other developing countries. The authors hope that this chapter may be of help to policy makers in identifying the constraints to economic growth and development that may be unique to each country.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2281", "subjectTags": ["access to loans", "administrative assistance", "adult mortality", "adult population", "aged", "aggregate poverty", "agricultural produce", "aids epidemic", "average household income", "bank office", "basic needs", "benefits of migration", "business ownership", "capital investment", "caribbean region", "cash expenditures", "chronic illness", "citizens", "consumption aggregate", "consumption expenditure", "consumption per capita", "consumption smoothing", "coping strategy", "counterfactual", "country of destination", "cultural barriers", "decline in poverty", "demographic characteristics", "demographic composition", "developing countries", "development bank", "dissemination", "divorce", "domestic labor", "drought", "earnings", "economic development", "economic growth", "economic opportunities", "economic shocks", "education level", "education levels", "employer", "employment opportunities", "exclusion", "expatriates", "exploitation", "export markets", "families", "family members", "fertility", "financial constraints", "financial cost", "food consumption", "food consumption per capita", "foreign direct investment", "full potential of migration", "gender", "global development", "government policies", "government policy", "gross domestic product", "head of household", "hiv", "household assets", "household budget", "household consumption", "household expenditures on food", "household head", "household head age", "household income", "household level", "household number", "household size", "household survey", "household welfare", "housing", "human capital", "husband", "husbands", "illness", "immigration", "immigration policies", "impact of migration", "imperfect information", "income distribution", "income dynamics", "income gains", "income groups", "income growth", "income inequality", "inheritance", "insurance", "interest rates", "international bank", "international migrant", "international migrants", "international migration", "intervention", "isolation", "job opportunities", "kinship", "kinship networks", "labor market", "labor market activities", "labor markets", "labor mobility", "lack of credit", "lack of finance", "lack of information", "land holdings", "land value", "legal status", "limited access", "living standards", "loan", "low-income countries", "malaria", "market failures", "marketing", "medical treatment", "migrant", "migrant workers", "migrants", "migration", "migration process", "millennium development goals", "ministry of health", "moneylenders", "mother", "mountain region", "national borders", "natural disasters", "per capita consumption", "permanent migration status", "physical capital", "policy implications", "policy makers", "policy research", "policy research working paper", "political economy", "political instability", "poor", "poor households", "poor individuals", "poor people", "poor rural regions", "poorer households", "population and development", "population growth", "poverty data", "poverty dynamics", "poverty impact", "poverty indicators", "poverty levels", "poverty line", "poverty linkages", "poverty rate", "poverty rates", "poverty reduction", "practitioners", "production process", "progress", "public policy", "pull factors", "purchasing power", "purchasing power parity", "push factors", "qualitative data", "reduction in poverty", "regional capital", "regional labor", "regional labor markets", "regional office", "remittance", "remittances", "remote areas", "remote locations", "resource allocation", "respect", "return migration", "risk sharing", "rural", "rural area", "rural areas", "rural migration", "rural regions", "rural villages", "savings", "schooling", "sex", "siblings", "social networks", "social norms", "social policy", "social protection", "socioeconomic status", "source of income", "source of opportunities", "spillover", "spouse", "teens", "temporary migrants", "temporary migration", "traditional values", "undocumented migration", "unemployment", "urban areas", "urban center", "urban migration", "urbanization", "use per capita", "village", "violence", "young adults"], "pubtype": ["Directions in Development ;

This book is a comprehensive look at the demand and supply of skills in Indonesia how skills have changed, how they will continue to evolve, and how the education and training sectors can be improved to be more responsive and relevant to the needs of the labor market and the economy as a whole. Using an innovative firm survey, the authors shed light on the functional skills that workers must possess to be employable and to support firms' competitiveness and productivity. They also assess the role of the education and training systems in providing those skills. Although this book focuses specifically on Indonesia, its methodologies, messages, and analysis will be instructive for researchers and policy makers who shape the delivery of education and training in other middle-income countries around the world.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2282", "subjectTags": ["academic skills", "access to education", "accreditation", "adults", "age groups", "assessment framework", "assessment methodology", "basic skills", "career opportunities", "classroom", "computer skills", "creating jobs", "creative thinking", "critical thinking", "curriculum", "curriculum relevance", "demand for education", "diplomas", "drivers", "early childhood", "educated workers", "education for youth", "education institutions", "education level", "education management", "education programs", "education quality", "education systems", "educational achievement", "educational attainment", "educational level", "educational qualifications", "educational quality", "educational units", "employability", "employee", "employment", "employment growth", "employment outcomes", "employment share", "employment situation", "enrollment targets", "fields of study", "firm survey", "firm surveys", "formal education", "formal education sector", "formal education system", "formal training", "functional skills", "general secondary education", "generic skills", "ger", "gross enrollment", "gross enrollment rate", "gross enrollment rates", "high school", "high unemployment", "high unemployment rates", "higher education", "higher education institution", "higher education institutions", "human development", "human resource", "human resource development", "informal education", "informal training", "instructors", "internships", "job creation", "job experience", "job market", "job offers", "job placement", "job skills", "job training", "job turnover", "job vacancies", "jobless growth", "jobs", "labor force", "labor market", "labor markets", "labor regulations", "labor share", "language barriers", "leadership", "learning", "learning processes", "level of education", "levels of education", "life skills", "lifelong learning", "literacy", "manpower", "mathematics", "mobility", "national education", "net enrollment", "numeracy", "occupation", "occupational training", "occupations", "older workers", "on-the-job training", "papers", "parental education", "pedagogy", "preliminary evidence", "primary education", "primary schooling", "private institutions", "private sector", "problem solving", "product innovation", "production workers", "proficiency", "pupils", "quality of education", "quality standards", "rates of return", "reading", "research capacity", "retention rates", "rural workers", "school education", "school graduates", "school teachers", "schooling", "science study", "secondary education", "secondary school", "secondary school teachers", "secondary schools", "service sector", "service sectors", "skill acquisition", "skill development", "skill premium", "skill premiums", "skill requirements", "skill shortage", "skilled labor", "skilled workers", "skilled workforce", "skills development", "skills training", "student assessment", "subject areas", "teacher", "teacher training", "teaching", "teaching methodologies", "teaching quality", "teaching-learning", "teaching-learning process", "technological innovation", "temporary workers", "tertiary education", "test scores", "total employment", "trainees", "training center", "training firms", "training institutes", "training institutions", "training opportunities", "training programs", "training services", "training system", "unemployed", "unemployment", "unemployment rates", "universities", "university education", "unskilled workers", "vocational education", "vocational schools", "vocational skills", "vocational training", "vouchers", "wage bill", "wage compression", "wage growth", "wage premium", "wage premiums", "work experience", "worker", "workplace organization", "young people", "young workers", "younger workers", "youth employment", "youth unemployment"], "pubtype": ["Directions in Development"], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2282/608120PUB0Skil10Box358333B01PUBLIC1.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2282/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2282", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:03:10Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2283": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2283/608100PUB0Mana10Box358332B01PUBLIC1.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2283/608100PUB0Mana10Box358332B01PUBLIC1.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Managing Openness : Trade and Outward-oriented Growth After the Crisis", "abstract": "The global financial crisis is stimulating a broad reassessment of economic integration policies in developed and developing countries alike. The crisis was associated with a great trade collapse, the sharpest in recorded history and the deepest since Second World War (Baldwin 2009). The trade collapse affected all countries and products, although to different extents. While signs of recovery are starting to solidify, deeper questioning of the causes of the crisis and the merits of globalization has surfaced. The emergence of China and the imbalances of its trade with the United States are shaking the stability of the global system. Are these imbalances sustainable, or do they need to be adjusted to avoid another global crisis? What impact will these adjustments have on the trade of developing countries if they mean that China consumes more and the United States saves more? Openness has helped support growth in many countries, to unprecedented levels in Brazil, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, and others. Yet today many are concerned that openness is creating vulnerability, and vulnerability can hurt growth. No one believes that inward orientation is the solution or that domestic consumption alone can boost growth, even in large countries. The longer-term benefits of openness more than compensate for the short-term negative impacts of trade shocks. The question is not whether to remain open but rather what kind of safety and insurance systems, at the micro and macro levels, to put in place to better hedge against shocks from globalization. As developing countries try to find answers to these questions, they also face a drastically changed trade environment. The crisis proved that protectionism is no longer the name of the game; it remained largely under control thanks to a solid multilateral regime as well as to a new system of production sharing across countries, which does not lend itself naturally to broad-based protectionism. Moreover, the role of South-South trade is growing, giving developing countries new opportunities to export and new opportunities to import cheaper capital goods, now produced in countries like China or India, that allow them to industrialize faster. Thus, while outward-oriented growth is here to stay, it needs to be put in a different perspective and packaged with additional policies. As the world emerges from the crisis, the author expect to see the development of an 'export-led growth version 2.0' model that reflects these new dynamics.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2283", "subjectTags": ["crisis"], "pubtype": ["Trade and Development"], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2283/608100PUB0Mana10Box358332B01PUBLIC1.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2283/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2283", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:03:12Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2354": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2354/646690PUB0one000Box361543B00PUBLIC0.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2354/646690PUB0one000Box361543B00PUBLIC0.txt?sequence=2", "title": "One Goal, Two Paths : Achieving Universal Access to Modern\r\nEnergy in East Asia and the Pacific", "abstract": "The purpose of the current flagship report is to address energy access and related developmental issues in East Asia Pacific (EAP) that so far have received less attention compared to the macro energy issues of climate change and reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. EAP countries have two steep paths to climb to achieve universal access to modern energy: electricity and modern cooking solutions. Approximately 170 million people, or 34 million households, in EAP countries do not have electricity connections in their homes. This number is equivalent to approximately 9 percent of the Region's total population, and 30 percent of the Region's population excluding China. Moreover, approximately 6 times that number, or over 1 billion people, still lack access to modern cooking solutions. In addition, EAP is exceeded by only Sub Saharan Africa and South Asia in the number of people who lack access to electricity. However, access to both electricity and modern cooking solutions is essential to address the enduring impacts of poverty and to move the poor onto a rising development trajectory. The link between access to modern energy and development is most clearly defined by the Millennium Development Goals (MDG). The MDGs were formulated to reduce global poverty while increasing education, empowering women, and improving child and maternal health.

First, policy makers should focus on increasing competition within and outside the banking sector to foster innovation. This implies a more open regulatory mindset, possibly reversing the usual timeline of legislation-regulation-innovation for new players and products. It also implies expanding traditional infrastructure, such as credit registries and payment systems beyond banks. Second, the focus should be on services rather than existing institutions and markets. Expanding provision of payment, savings and other financial services to the unbanked might mean looking beyond existing institutions, products, and delivery channels, such as banks, traditional checking accounts, and brick-and-mortar branches. All financial sector policy is local. To reap the benefits of globalization, regional integration, and technology, policy makers have to recognize the politics of financial deepening and build constituencies for financial sector reform. While the challenges of expanding access, lengthening contracts, and safeguarding the financial system are similar, the ways of addressing them will depend on the circumstances and context of each country. With its cautiously optimistic tone, this book creates an opportunity for Africa's policy makers, private sector, civil society, and development partners to harness the progress of the past as a way to address the challenges of the future and enable the financial sector to play its rightful role in Africa's transformation.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2355", "subjectTags": [""], "pubtype": [], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2355/646640PUB0fina00Box361543B00PUBLIC0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2355/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2355", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:04:45Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2326": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2326/632520PUB0Exto00public00BOX361512B0.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2326/632520PUB0Exto00public00BOX361512B0.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Assessing Sector Performance and Inequality in Education : Streamlined Analysis with ADePT Software", "abstract": "This book gathers in one volume all the information related to Automated DEC [Development Economics - Vice Presidency at the World Bank] Poverty Tables (ADePT) Edu, the software platform created by the World Bank for reporting and analyzing education indicators and education inequality.

Across the continent, the availability and quality of service have gone up and the cost has gone down. In just 10 years dating from the end of the 1990s mobile network coverage rose from 16 percent to 90 percent of the urban population; by 2009, rural coverage stood at just under 50 percent of the population. Although the performance of Africa's mobile networks over the past decade has been remarkable, the telecommunications sector in the rest of the world has also evolved rapidly. Many countries now regard broadband Internet as central to their long-term economic development strategies, and many companies realize that the use of ICT is the key to maintaining profitability. This book is about that challenge and others. Chapters two and three describe the recent history of the telecommunications market in Africa; they cover such issues as prices, access, the performance of the networks, and the regulatory reforms that have triggered much of the investment. This part of the book compares network performance across the region and tries to explain why some countries have moved so much more quickly than others in providing affordable telecommunications services. Chapter four explores the financial side of the telecommunications revolution in Africa and details how the massive investments have been financed and which companies have most influenced the sector. Chapter five deals with the future of the sector.

The extent of the trade collapse was unprecedented: trade flows fell at a faster rate than had been observed even in the early years of the great depression. G-20 leaders held their first crisis-related summit in November 2008. The goal was to understand the root causes of the global crisis and to reach consensus on actions to address its immediate effects. In the case of trade, a key question concerned the extent to which a drying up of trade finance caused the observed decline in trade flows. This book brings together a range of projects and studies undertaken by development institutions, export credit agencies, private bankers, and academics to shed light on the role of trade finance in the 2008-09 great trade collapse. It provides policy makers, analysts, and other interested parties with analyses and assessments of the role of governments and institutions in restoring trade finance markets. A deeper understanding of the complexity of trade finance remains critical as the world economy recovers and the supply of trade finance improves. The international community continues to know too little about the fragility of low income economies in response to trade finance developments and shocks, as well as about the ability and conditions of access to trade finance by small and medium enterprises and small banks in developing countries. Similarly, there is uncertainty regarding the impact on trade finance of recent changes in the third Basel regulatory framework.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2324", "subjectTags": ["access to

The social dimension of the dismal growth performance is well captured in the poverty rates. According to World Bank statistics, in the first half of the 1990s the average poverty rate in the region was close to 60 percent in countries such as Honduras and Nicaragua; almost three-quarters of the population lived on less than US$4 a day. Several lessons emerge from getting the most out of free trade agreements (FTAs) in Central America, but the author will like to stress three. First, Central America should not take the positive results of signed FTAs as a given. Second, trade promotion needs to be complemented by a strong focus on the poor. In some cases, this focus is because of the challenges brought by additional external competition, which may negatively affect some industries or sectors. Third, is the need for more competitive markets? Although many of us tend to think about the benefits of growth in terms of quantities (that is, more exports, more employment, and increased access to goods) many of the welfare effects of FTAs are transmitted through prices (such as lower prices for imported goods).", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2322", "subjectTags": ["trade"], "pubtype": ["Directions in Development ; trade"], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2322/632610PUB0Free00ID0187120BOX361512B.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2322/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2322", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:04:04Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2321": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2321/632600PUB0Fina00ID0186820BOX361512B.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2321/632600PUB0Fina00ID0186820BOX361512B.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Financing Health Care in East Asia and the Pacific : Best Practices and Remaining Challenges", "abstract": "This is an exciting time in East Asia and the Pacific region.

Moreover, some common issues appear to be emerging: universal insurance, options for financing health insurance, institutional setups of health financing options, provider payment mechanisms, equity considerations, ways to reach the poor and impoverished, and ways to meet the challenges of a changing demographics and epidemiologic profile.

What this estimate does not capture are the societal costs of corruption and the devastating impact of such crimes on victim countries. Theft of assets by corrupt officials, often at the highest levels of government, weakens confidence in public institutions, damages the private investment climate, and divests needed funding available for core investment in such poverty alleviation measures as public health, education, and infrastructure.

Preferential trade agreements (PTAs) have become a central instrument of regional integration in all parts of the world. Beyond market access and the progressive elimination of barriers at the border, PTAs are increasingly being used to address a host of behind-the-border issues, also known as 'deep integration' issues, in order to promote cooperation in the areas of investment, trade facilitation, competition policy, and government procurement, as well as wider social issues related to the regulation of the environment and the protection of labor and human rights. The purpose of this handbook is to explore the various ways in which policy makers and trade negotiators in the developing world can limit the costs and maximize the benefits of their regional integration efforts. PTAs have become a cornerstone of the international trade system. The surge in their number and scope is fast reshaping the architecture of the world trading system and the trading environment of developing countries. The integration of these diverse agreements into a multilateral framework that facilitates the expansion of trade is likely to be one of the main challenges facing the world trading system in the coming years. This handbook offers an introduction to the complex world of modern PTAs. It follows in the steps of earlier, seminal World Bank publications on the economics and practice of PTAs, notably new dimensions in regional integration, trade blocs, and regional integration and development. Supplementing these earlier publications, this volume aims at taking its audience beyond the traditional market access paradigm to consider more broadly and systematically the numerous regulatory policy dimensions that are contained in modern PTAs. In particular, it offers a framework for understanding a number of behind-the-border policies typically covered in PTAs, including labor mobility, investment, trade facilitation, competition, and government procurement, as well as other societal and more normative policies related to intellectual property, environment, labor rights, and human rights. These latter are increasingly among the policies driven by powerful trading blocs as they strive to influence developing countries and the evolution of the global trading system. The handbook is also inspired by the numerous requests received by the World Bank from developing countries or groups of developing countries worldwide for advice on PTAs, including those currently being negotiated, as an aid in understanding the obligations and the possible economic and development implications of various provisions.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2329", "subjectTags": [""], "pubtype": [], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2329/634040PUB0Pref00Box0361517B0PUBLIC0.pdf.jpg?sequence=5", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2329/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2329", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:04:14Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2353": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2353/646660PUB0Phar00Box361543B00PUBLIC0.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2353/646660PUB0Phar00Box361543B00PUBLIC0.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Pharmaceutical Reform : A Guide to Improving Performance and Equity", "abstract": "This publication, which is based on the unique methodology and tools developed for the World Bank Institute/Harvard School of Public Health Flagship Course on Health System Reform and Sustainable Financing, provides a powerful set of resources to help policy makers better navigate the complicated process of reforming pharmaceutical systems. Its problem solving approach complements technical resources and training curricula available on the discrete elements of a pharmaceutical sector. The application of the flagship approach to the pharmaceutical sector is both useful and timely. Ensuring the availability of medicines and the effective management of their procurement and distribution is central to the drive to achieve coverage and access to basic health care that is both universal and financially sustainable. Together, the methodology and case materials contained in this publication provide a rich resource from which policy makers in developing countries may draw to guide their efforts to meet these challenges. This book is designed to help participants gain a better understanding of all that goes on in the pharmaceutical sector. As noted above, it uses the flagship framework that we helped develop over the past decade. The essence of that approach is not to try to tell policy makers in detail what they should do. Rather it comprises a set of analytical tools that are combined into an overall, structured methodology for developing, adopting, and implementing reform proposals. The flagship framework also includes a comprehensive review of reform alternatives and a systematic review of their strengths and weaknesses in various situations. Throughout this book the authors have used the flagship framework to structure our analysis of pharmaceutical reform, continuously and explicitly applying its methods and concepts to the pharmaceutical sector. With a few minor exceptions, all the examples and all of the reform options come directly from pharmaceutical reform efforts around the world. The authors have also given specific attention to issues in pharmaceutical policy related to reproductive health.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2353", "subjectTags": ["abuse", "accountability", "acquired immunodeficiency syndrome", "biologicals", "brand", "bribery", "budgeting", "cancer", "capsules", "cardiovascular disease", "central medical stores", "chemists", "child mortality", "chronic diseases", "cif", "citizens", "citizenship", "civil society organizations", "clinical trials", "clinics", "commodities", "competitive bidding", "competitiveness", "complications", "consumer groups", "corruption", "death rates", "decision making", "delivery systems", "democracy", "developing countries", "development goals", "development policy", "diabetes", "disability", "discrimination", "dissemination", "distribution systems", "domestic manufacturers", "donor financing", "dosage forms", "drug control", "drug donations", "drug industry", "drug prices", "drugs", "economic growth", "education systems", "emerging markets", "environmental protection", "essential drugs", "essential medicines", "families", "family members", "favoritism", "fixed costs", "fraud", "future growth", "generic drugs", "global development", "global policy", "gmp", "good governance", "good manufacturing practices", "government agencies", "health care", "health care access", "health care providers", "health care reform", "health care system", "health centers", "health facilities", "health insurance", "health management", "health outcomes", "health policies", "health policy", "health reform", "health sector", "health services", "health system", "health systems", "health workers", "high blood pressure", "hiv", "home countries", "hospital", "hospitals", "human development", "human immunodeficiency virus", "illness", "illnesses", "immunization", "immunodeficiency", "imported drugs", "industrial development", "industrial production", "information systems", "intermediaries", "international agreements", "international organizations", "inventory", "inventory management", "laboratories", "laws", "legal status", "life expectancy", "local economy", "local manufacturers", "low-income countries", "low-income country", "malaria", "management systems", "market entry", "marketing", "medical education", "medical needs", "medical school", "medical services", "medical specialists", "medical supplies", "medicine", "medicines", "millennium development goals", "ministries of health", "ministry of health", "mortality", "narcotics", "national drug", "national government", "national legislation", "nurse", "nurses", "nutrition", "operating costs", "packaging", "patient", "patients", "payment terms", "personal relationships", "pharmaceutical", "pharmaceutical companies", "pharmaceutical expenditure", "pharmaceutical industry", "pharmaceutical manufacturers", "pharmaceutical marketing", "pharmaceutical markets", "pharmaceutical policies", "pharmaceutical policy", "pharmaceutical pricing", "pharmaceutical pricing policies", "pharmaceutical procurement", "pharmaceutical products", "pharmaceutical reform", "pharmaceutical regulation", "pharmaceutical sector", "pharmaceutical supply", "pharmaceutical ??

Part one focuses on clarifying the basic concepts (that is, what are the appropriate goals of economic policy?), the challenges of low- and middle-income developing countries, and suggested frameworks for analysis. Part two moves from the macroeconomic to the microeconomic; it focuses on the private sector as the engine for growth and is balanced with 'softer' issues of the need for trust, accountability, and corporate social responsibility. Part three examines the growing consensus on the need to balance the public and private sectors' roles in the structural transformation of an economy. The discussion centers on newer thinking on industrial policy and public private partnerships in infrastructure. Part four focuses on human development policies in emerging topics, such as investment in early childhood development, health and nutrition, and quality of education. The discussion recognizes the roles of the state and the private sector. Finally, part five is dedicated to issues of global shocks and risks (including climate change and financial crisis), as well as systems and institutions that need to be in place to manage such risks, and the new thinking on social protection and insurance to mitigate adverse shocks.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2350", "subjectTags": ["development"], "pubtype": [], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2350/644420PUB0Fron00ID0187850BOX361537B.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2350/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2350", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:04:38Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2351": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2351/644410PUB00Gro00ID0188020BOX361537B.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2351/644410PUB00Gro00ID0188020BOX361537B.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Growing Old in an Older Brazil : Implications of Population Ageing on Growth, Poverty, Public Finance, and Service Delivery", "abstract": "This chapter introduces the main issues associated with population aging, many of which will be investigated in detail throughout the volume.

It identifies channels of technology transfer and absorption through trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) and constraints to greater technology absorption, and it discusses policy options open to the government and the private sector in light of relevant international experience. The book is based on case studies of sectors and enterprises selected in four countries: Lesotho, Mauritius, Namibia, and South Africa. The relationship between technology absorption and catch-up growth is particularly relevant to southern Africa because those countries are facing tremendous competitiveness challenges and must rely on greater technology absorption to raise productivity and strengthen competitiveness to gain ground in the global market. An increased market share can then generate faster growth and create more jobs. Therefore, catch-up growth sustained by technological progress and productivity growth is the fundamental solution to unemployment and poverty alleviation. Southern African firms use multiple channels for technology absorption. For example, South African auto component firms entered technology agreements with global players to meet the demanding product standards required for export. Even after the global crisis in 2009, those who licensed technologies still spent 2.23 percent of their sales revenue on royalties. In Namibia, the meat-processing industry has made continuous efforts to upgrade technology, including the recent investment in radio frequency identification technology to trace cattle. In fish processing, companies use state-of-the-art production technologies, including electronic software to record and monitor production processes, intelligent portioning equipment, and sophisticated freezer systems. In the breweries sector, state-of-the-art technology is used at every stage of production and in the marketing and distribution processes.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2356", "subjectTags": ["access to technology", "action plan", "action plans", "advanced technology", "antennas", "artisan", "automotive", "barriers to entry", "basic", "bi", "biotechnologies", "business activities", "business environment", "business process", "business process outsourcing", "business sector", "business services", "business strategy", "businesses", "buyer", "buyers", "capabilities", "capital flows", "capital investment", "certificate", "collaboration", "commerce", "commodities", "communication technology", "communities", "comparator countries", "competition policy", "competitive advantage", "competitiveness", "computers", "consulting services", "copying", "copyright", "debt", "doi", "domestic economies", "domestic economy", "domestic firm", "domestic firms", "e-mail", "economic catch-up", "economic development", "economic growth", "economic policy", "economic reform", "economic relations", "economics", "economies of scale", "electrical machinery", "electronic media", "electronic software", "engineering", "engineers", "enterprise survey", "enterprise surveys", "equipment", "export processing zone", "export processing zones", "fdi", "financial constraints", "financial system", "foreign competition", "foreign direct investment", "foreign enterprises", "foreign firms", "foreign investment", "foreign investors", "foreign technologies", "game theory", "global economy", "global market", "global marketplace", "globalization", "government policies", "growth path", "harmonization", "higher education institutions", "host country", "host economy", "human capital", "human resource", "human resource development", "human resources", "ict", "image", "industrial development", "industrial upgrading", "information technology", "innovation policies", "innovation policy", "innovation systems", "installation", "institution", "institutional framework", "intellectual property", "intellectual property rights", "international competition", "international standard", "international standards", "international trade", "inventions", "inventors", "investment climate", "investment policies", "joint ventures", "key industries", "know-how", "knowledge acquisition", "knowledge economy", "knowledge transfer", "learning", "lending operations", "license", "license fees", "licenses", "licensing", "literacy", "manufacturing", "manufacturing industries", "manufacturing sector", "manufacturing sectors", "market competition", "market failure", "market failures", "market price", "market share", "market structure", "market structures", "marketing", "material", "media", "medium enterprises", "networks", "new markets", "new technologies", "new technology", "organizational innovation", "outsourcing", "patents", "photo", "private partnership", "private sector", "private sector development", "private sectors", "procurement", "procurement policies", "product designs", "production process", "production processes", "production techniques", "productivity", "programs", "project management", "queries", "r&d", "radio", "radio frequency", "radio frequency identification", "regulatory framework", "research results", "result", "rfid", "science foundation", "service providers", "sites", "small firms", "smes", "standardization", "supervision", "tacit knowledge", "tax incentive", "tax incentives", "technical assistance", "technical assistance project", "technical training", "technicians", "technological development", "technological information", "technological innovation", "technological innovations", "technological knowledge", "technological progress", "technology content", "technology gap", "technology gaps", "technology innovation", "technology policy", "technology sector", "technology transfer", "telecommunication", "telephone", "text", "turnover rates"], "pubtype": ["Directions in development ;

These research universities provide advanced education for the academic profession, policy makers, and public and private sector professionals involved in the complex, globalized economies of the 21st century. In addition to their contribution to economic development, these universities play a key societal role by serving as cultural institutions, centers for social commentary and criticism, and intellectual hubs. The positive contribution of tertiary education is increasingly recognized as not limited to middle-income and advanced countries, because it applies equally to low-income economies. Tertiary education can help these countries to become more globally competitive by developing a skilled, productive, and flexible labor force and by creating, applying, and spreading new ideas and technologies. A recent study on how to accelerate economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa spells out the crucial contribution of tertiary education in supporting this endeavor (World Bank 2008). It observes that the key for success in a globalized world increasingly lies in how effectively a country can assimilate available knowledge and build comparative advantages in areas with higher growth prospects and how it can use technology to address the most pressing environmental challenges.

Higher-level institutions in Sub-Saharan Africa that is equipped to impart quality education and conduct relevant applied research can play a critical role in producing workers with the skills to assimilate technology and make effective decisions that help industry to diversify into a broader range of products. Good-quality and relevant higher education is also a key to stimulating innovations in new varieties of crops, new materials, or sources of energy that would facilitate progress toward reducing poverty, achieving food security, and improving health. This report is a follow-up to the 2008 study. It examines current practices in financing higher education in Sub-Saharan Africa, taking into account the significant differences that exist among countries. Drawing on experience from around the world, the report also examines the range of policy options that could be considered in tackling the financing issue. The report also carries an encouraging message. It shows that a full range of options do exist and that some African countries and institutions have started implementing them. Private higher education is experiencing spectacular growth in Africa. Cost-sharing programs are being implemented in many universities, accompanied by student loans and financial aid for low-income students. Higher education is being diversified to offer lower cost and more effective delivery alternatives. In a few cases, impressive reforms to improve internal efficiency have been implemented, and governments are increasingly adopting more effective budget management practices.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2448", "subjectTags": ["academic excellence", "academic performance", "academic research", "academic staff", "academic year", "access rate", "access to higher education", "access to secondary education", "accreditation", "accreditation system", "achievement of education", "annual expenditure per student", "application of knowledge", "applied research", "assistant professors", "association of african universities", "average number of students", "basic education", "classroom", "classrooms", "completion rates", "cost per student", "degrees", "deterioration in quality", "disadvantaged students", "disciplines", "distance education", "doctoral students", "education budget", "education expenditures", "education for all", "education policy", "education programs", "education sector", "education services", "education statistics", "educational institutions", "educational quality", "educational systems", "employment", "enrollment capacity", "enrollment rates", "enrollment ratio", "examination fees", "expenditures", "expenditures per student", "faculty members", "foreign students", "formula funding", "free higher education", "geographic distribution", "gross enrollment", "gross enrollment ratio", "health care", "higher education", "higher education development", "higher education enrollment", "higher education financing", "higher education growth", "higher education institutions", "higher education loans", "higher education quality", "higher education sector", "higher education students", "higher education subsector", "higher education system", "higher education systems", "human capital", "human development", "income-generating activities", "information technology", "institutional autonomy", "instruction", "instructors", "introduction of tuition", "introduction of tuition fees", "labor market needs", "labor markets", "learning", "learning environment", "lecturers", "level of education", "levels of education", "libraries", "low-income students", "lower secondary education", "ministry of education", "national accreditation", "national autonomous university", "national school", "national university", "number of students", "number of teachers", "pedagogical level", "pedagogical quality", "postgraduate training", "primary level", "primary school", "primary school completion", "primary school students", "private education", "private higher education", "private higher education institutions", "private institutions", "professional programs", "professors", "provision of education", "public expenditure", "public expenditure on education", "public expenditures", "public expenditures on education", "public higher education", "public tertiary education", "public tertiary education institutions", "public universities", "quality education", "quality of education", "quality of higher education", "quality of instruction", "quality training", "rate of expansion", "regional universities", "registration fees", "repayment obligation", "repayment periods", "repetition rates", "research capacity", "research centers", "research funding", "research output", "researchers", "resources per student", "scholars", "scholarships", "school enrollment", "scientists", "secondary education", "secondary school", "shortage of faculty", "social groups", "sports", "staff development", "staff salaries", "student associations", "student costs", "student debt", "student dropout", "student financial aid", "student flow", "student flows", "student loan", "student loan programs", "student loan schemes", "student loans", "student population", "student support", "student-teacher ratio", "student-teacher ratios", "teacher", "teacher ratios", "teachers", "teaching", "teaching materials", "tertiary education", "tertiary education community", "tertiary education institutions", "tertiary education policies", "tertiary education sector", "tertiary institutions", "textbook", "training institutions", "training programs", "tuition", "tuition fee", "tuition fees", "tuition policies", "universal primary education", "universities", "university graduates", "university leaders", "university operating budgets", "vocational training", "workers", "young people", "youth"], "pubtype": ["Directions in Development ;

As rapid urban growth continues, energy use in cities and associated levels of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are projected to continue unabated; current projections indicate that approximately 70 percent of the world's population will live in cities by 2050, producing some 80 percent of the world's GHG emissions. Unfortunately, most of this urban growth will take place in developing countries, where the vast majority of people remain underserved by basic infrastructure service and where city authorities are under-resourced to shift current trajectories. Further, the developing regions of Africa and Asia are where the most rapid urbanization is taking place, and they are least able to cope with the uncertainties and extremities of climate impacts. The development and mainstreaming of energy-efficient and low-carbon urban pathways that curtail climate impacts without hampering the urban development agenda thus are essential to meeting such challenges. Reducing long-term energy use through efficiency also enhances energy security by decreasing dependence on imported and fossil fuel. In addition, lower energy costs free up a city's resources to improve or expand services while providing important local co-benefits, creating new jobs, enhancing competitiveness, improving air quality and health, and providing a better quality of life. The scope of the papers encapsulates all three urban contexts: new cities, expanding cities, and retrofitting existing cities. The range of policy-relevant conceptual tools and practices discussed during the sessions, and subsequently built upon in this volume, helps achieve a better understanding of leverage points for energy-efficiency interventions and helps catalyze solutions that will delink high levels of carbon-intensive energy use from urban growth without compromising local development priorities.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2449", "subjectTags": ["affordable energy", "air quality", "approach", "carbon", "carbon finance", "cities", "cities alliance", "city development", "city development strategies", "city halls", "city leaders", "city managers", "city services", "clean technology", "conservation", "economic development", "emissions", "energy costs", "energy demand", "energy efficiency", "energy efficiency improvements", "energy efficiency measures", "energy investments", "energy policies", "energy savings", "energy sector", "energy sector management assistance", "energy services", "energy use", "environmental impacts", "fuels", "global environment", "global environment facility", "greenhouse", "greenhouse gases", "housing", "lighting", "mayors", "reducing energy use", "service providers", "slum upgrading", "sustainable energy", "technical assistance", "urban energy", "urbanization", "utilities", "water utilities"], "pubtype": [], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2449/544330PUB0EPI01BOX0349415B01PUBLIC1.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2449/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2449", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:33:53Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2446": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2446/544370PUB0EPI010BOX349416B01PUBLIC1.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2446/544370PUB0EPI010BOX349416B01PUBLIC1.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Economic Opportunities for Women in the East Asia and Pacific region", "abstract": "East Asia and the Pacific is a region of dynamic growth.

How many people will the crisis prevent from escaping poverty, and how many will remain hungry? How many more infants will die? Are children being pulled out of schools, not getting the education they need to become more productive adults and making it virtually impossible to reach 100 percent completion in primary education by 2015? What are the gender dimensions of the impacts? These are some of the questions as the global economy comes out of the worst recession since the great depression. The questions do not have immediate answers, partly because the data to assess development outcomes are incomplete and collected infrequently but also because impacts can take several years to emerge. For example, deteriorating health and nutrition today could lead to higher mortality rates in subsequent years. Lower investments will hamper future progress in sanitation and water supply. Fewer children in school will lower completion rates in later years. And household incomes that fall far below the poverty line will delay escapes from poverty. This report uses indirect evidence to assess the impact of the crisis on several indicators, including the number of people who will not escape poverty, the increase in infant mortality, the number of children who will be denied education, and the increase in discrimination against women. Based on that assessment, the report identifies key policies necessary for the developing countries, donors, and the international financial institutions (IFIs) to reestablish progress toward the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2444", "subjectTags": ["air pollution", "biodiversity", "biomass", "carbon", "carbon dioxide", "carbon dioxide emissions", "carbon intensity", "clean development mechanism", "climate scenarios", "coal", "coastal populations", "common property", "common property resources", "conceptual framework", "data availability", "debt", "debt service", "deforestation", "demographic", "demographic trends", "developed countries", "developing countries", "development strategies", "drinking water", "economic development", "economic growth", "economic policies", "ecosystem", "energy efficiency", "energy intensity", "energy resources", "energy technologies", "energy use", "environmental", "environmental analysis", "environmental challenges", "environmental impact", "environmental issues", "environmental management", "environmental problems", "environmental quality", "environmental sustainability", "exploitation", "financial development", "financial developments", "financial flows", "financial institutions", "fisheries", "fossil fuels", "fuel", "fund management", "gender equality", "global climate", "global climate change", "global funds", "governance indicators", "greenhouse", "greenhouse gas", "greenhouse gases", "harmonization", "human development", "human health", "human welfare", "impact on health", "income", "incomes", "indoor air pollution", "institutional capacity", "intangible", "international community", "leading causes", "leading causes of death", "loss of biodiversity", "low-income countries", "low-income country", "malaria", "market access", "middle-income countries", "millennium development goal", "millennium development goals", "mitigation potential", "multilateral development", "national level", "national progress", "natural resource", "natural resource management", "natural resource problems", "natural resources", "nutrition", "official development assistance", "oil", "policy formulation", "poor households", "poor people", "population strategy", "poverty reduction", "precipitation", "private investment", "private sector development", "productivity", "progress", "public goods", "sanitation", "sustainable development", "sustainable growth", "technology transfer", "tradeoffs", "vulnerability", "waste", "waste management", "world trade"], "pubtype": ["Global Monitoring Report"], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2444/544380PUB0EPI01BOX0349416B01PUBLIC1.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2444/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2444", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:33:47Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2359": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2359/648210PUB0Resi0C0disclosed010050110.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2359/648210PUB0Resi0C0disclosed010050110.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Resilience of an African Giant : Boosting Growth and Development in the Democratic Republic of Congo", "abstract": "The size, resources, and location of the Democratic Republic of Congo have an impact on all of Central Africa.

Commission on Growth and Development", "abstract": "The commission on growth and development was established in April 2006 as a response to two observations. While the author felt that the benefits of growth were not fully appreciated, the author recognized that the causes of growth were not fully understood. Growth is often overlooked and underrated as an instrument for tackling the world's most pressing problems, such as poverty, illiteracy, income inequality, unemployment, and pollution. At the same time, understanding of economic growth is less definitive than commonly thought, even though advice sometimes has been given to developing countries with greater confidence than perhaps the state of our knowledge will justify. Consequently, the commission's mandate was to 'take stock of the state of theoretical and empirical knowledge on economic growth with a view to drawing implications for policy for the current and next generation of policy makers.' This mandate has even more significance in the aftermath of the financial and economic crisis of 2008. As developing countries seek to repair the damage to their economies and to re-launch themselves on a sustained high-growth path, there has never been a greater need for fresh new ideas and approaches to achieving sustained high growth. There has been no dearth of commentary about what the crisis may mean, but in reality, until the bottom has been reached and the path to recovery is clear, it will be difficult to draw general lessons for the future. This collection of essays encompasses a variety of viewpoints and covers both medium- and long-term policy issues. It is said that more textbooks have become obsolete in 2009 than in any year since the great depression. As a corollary, much has been written that is worth reviewing in a volume on globalization. The papers look at the issue of globalization from diverse points of view and add insights and perspective to the recommendations of the growth report.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2440",

Part two focuses on the implementation of PEP measures by regulatory authorities and banks. Part three reviews the roles of the public authorities that are primarily involved in preventing abuse by corrupt PEPs. These authorities include the regulatory authority, which is responsible for providing guidance to banks and enforcing compliance, as well as the financial intelligence unit (FIU), which has a role in the context of suspicious transaction reports (STRs) on PEPs.

This year we are facing historic development challenges from natural disasters, to food and fuel price spikes, and profound change in the Middle East. Despite high beverage growth in the developing world, it is crucial to provide opportunities to those that are being left behind. Wealthier economies are experiencing slower growth but development assistance needs remain high. In our interconnected world, sustainable recovery means supporting inclusive growth. Only four years remain until the 2015 deadline for reaching the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The global monitoring report 2011: improving the odds of achieving the MDGs heterogeneity, gaps, and challenges underlines the urgency of helping countries that are behind on meeting key targets for extreme poverty, hunger, disease, and child and maternal mortality. The report lays out the challenges that remain; analyzes efforts to improve human development; and assesses the role of growth, policy reforms, trade, and donor policies in meeting the MDGs. The findings from this year's report offer reason for both hope and concern. The MDGs were designed to provide a framework for the entire international community to work together toward a common end: making sure that human development reaches everyone, everywhere.

suggests that migration generates benefits for migrants, the host societies, and the countries of origin. The economic benefits for the countries of origin are realized primarily through the receipt of remittances. These large and stable resource flows remained relatively resilient during the global financial crisis compared to steep declines in private capital flows, and they have quickly recovered to the pre crisis levels. African countries are estimated to have received $40 billion in officially recorded flows in 2010, but the true size is believed to be far larger. Remittances are associated with reduction in poverty, improved education and health outcomes, and increased availability of funds for small business investments. Remittances represent a positive and relatively noncontroversial outcome of migration. This volume brings together studies of remittance markets in eight Sub-Saharan African countries and two key destinations for African migrants outside the African continent. It provides an overview of the remittance markets, and the policy and institutional environments in both sending and receiving countries. Based on primary surveys of remittance service providers about the types of remittance services, barriers to entry and exit, legal and regulatory environment, remittance costs, and innovative technologies, the chapters of this volume provide a unique window into the functioning of remittance markets in this region. the volume, measures to reduce remittance fees, increase market competition and consumer protection, increase the involvement of post offices and other non-bank institutions, and encourage the extension of mobile money transfer services to cross-border remittances will benefit the ultimate clients, the people of Africa. I hope that the findings of this volume will motivate more research, improved data collection, and policy action in the area of migrant remittances in Africa.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2292", "subjectTags": ["access of migrants", "access to remittances", "account transfers", "account-to-account", "agricultural development", "asylum", "automatic teller", "automatic teller machine", "average transfer", "balance of payments", "balance of payments statistics", "bank account", "bank accounts", "bank branch", "bank branches", "banking services", "border transactions", "border transfers", "business loans", "capita income", "capital flows", "child labor", "child mortality", "costs of remittances", "countries of origin", "country of origin", "country remittances", "credit constraints", "credit cooperatives", "credit products", "data on remittances", "debit cards", "deposits", "destination country", "developing countries", "development impact of remittances", "direct deposit", "dissemination", "domestic money", "domestic money transfer", "domestic remittance", "domestic remittances", "economic downturns", "economic growth", "economic policies", "educational attainment", "effects of remittances", "electronic funds", "electronic transfers", "emigrant remittances", "emigration", "exchange rate", "exchange rates", "financial flows", "financial infrastructure", "financial institution", "financial intermediaries", "financial intermediation", "financial services", "financial services industry", "food security", "foreign currency", "foreign direct investment", "foreign exchange", "future remittance", "future remittances", "future remittances as collateral", "global remittances", "gross domestic product", "health care", "health care services", "household surveys", "identification requirements", "immigrant", "immigrant population", "immigrants", "immigration", "immigration restrictions", "impact of remittances", "importance of remittances", "income", "incomes", "increase in remittances", "informal channels", "informal flows", "informal remittance", "informal transfers", "international efforts", "international migrants", "international money orders", "international money transfer", "international remittance", "international remittance recipients", "international remittances", "labor supply", "legal status", "leverage remittances", "liquidity", "living standards", "local capacity", "macroeconomic level", "macroeconomic shock", "market competition", "migrant", "migrant destination countries", "migrant remittance", "migrant workers", "migrants", "migration data", "money laundering", "money order", "money transfer", "money transfer companies", "money transfer instruments", "money transfer operator", "money transfer operators", "money transfer services", "money transfer system", "money transfers", "money transmitters", "money-transfer companies", "natural disasters", "nutrition", "official development assistance", "payment services", "point of sale", "points of service", "policy implications", "post offices", "postal networks", "postal service", "postal services", "practitioners", "recipient countries", "recipient country", "recipient households", "regulatory framework", "remittance", "remittance business", "remittance channels", "remittance corridors", "remittance costs", "remittance data", "remittance flows", "remittance industry", "remittance inflows", "remittance market", "remittance marketplace", "remittance outflows", "remittance products", "remittance providers", "remittance receipts", "remittance receivables", "remittance recipients", "remittance sender", "remittance senders", "remittance service", "remittance service providers", "remittance services", "remittance transfers", "remittance-receiving households", "remittances for development", "remittances for investment", "remittances remittances", "resource flows", "return migrants", "rural areas", "saving money", "savings accounts", "school attendance", "secure transfer", "send money", "send remittances", "service provider", "small countries", "small remittances", "spouses", "technological innovations", "terrorist", "tertiary education", "transfer channels", "transfer money", "transfer of remittances", "transfer service", "undocumented migration", "unemployment", "unemployment rates", "use of remittances", "uses of remittances", "volume of remittance flows"], "pubtype": ["Directions in Development ;

As such it makes a significant contribution to the global debate on climate change and human rights by offering a comprehensive analysis of the international legal dimensions of this intersection. The study helps advance an understanding of what is meant, in legal and policy terms, by the human rights impacts of climate change through examples of specific substantive rights. It gives a legal and theoretic perspective on the connection between human rights and climate change along three dimensions: first, human rights may affect the enjoyment of human rights. Second, measures to address human rights may impact the realization of rights and third, that human rights have potential relevance to policy and operational responses to climate change, and may promote resilience to climate change, including in developing countries in a way that may help sustainable development. This study effectively consolidates knowledge from the fields of international human rights law, international law governing climate change and international environmental law, building on the existing work of the United Nation (UN) office of the high commissioner on human rights, the UN human rights council and the international council on human rights policy. Although it maintains a legal focus, the study has benefited from the input of a host of international experts from other disciplines as well.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2291",

Since 1984, the World Bank has financed 87 Financial Management Information System (FMIS) projects in 51 countries, totaling over US $2.2 billion, of which US $938 million was for FMIS-related Information and Communication Technology (ICT) solutions. This study presents the World Bank's experience with these investment operations, including substantial ICT components, in order to share the achievements and challenges observed, and provide guidance for improving the performance of future projects. This study is dived into five chapters. The introduction covers the definitions used and methodology applied in reviewing projects. Chapter 2 provides descriptive characteristics of the sample data drawn from Bank databases and describes general patterns in duration, regional distribution, costs, and ICT solutions implemented, among other aspects. Chapter 3 analyzes the performance of the projects, differentiating between ratings of the Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs) and the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) reports, as well as the factors contributing to the success and failure of projects and individual components. A detailed analysis of country case studies from Mongolia, Turkey, Albania, Guatemala, and Pakistan are presented in chapter 4. In conclusion, chapter 5 synthesizes the main lessons learned and prerequisites necessary for an effective FMIS project. The findings of this study are based on a comprehensive database of 55 closed and 32 active Treasury and FMIS projects implemented between 1984 and 2010 (pipeline projects were also analyzed in some sections). The data presented here was gathered from individual project ICRs, Project Appraisal Documents (PADs), the IEG reports, and complemented with interviews with task team leaders and relevant public sector and informatics specialists.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2297", "subjectTags": ["access to information", "accountability", "accounting", "accounting standards", "accounts payable", "action plan", "actual cost", "application software", "automation", "backup", "basic", "bidding", "broadband", "broadband networks", "business processes", "buying power", "capabilities", "capacity building", "chart of accounts", "client countries", "client server", "coding", "collaboration", "commercial software", "communication network", "communication technologies", "communication technology", "communities", "competitive bidding", "competitiveness", "components", "connectivity", "consolidation", "copying", "copyright", "customs", "data analysis", "data centers", "data collection", "data storage", "debt", "decentralization", "decision making", "description", "development of information", "digital", "digital certificates", "digital signature", "e-government", "e-government systems", "e-mail", "electronic payment", "enabling environment", "engineering", "equipment", "external consultants", "financial management", "financial management systems", "financial operations", "financial systems", "financial transactions", "functionality", "general public", "government expenditure", "government policy", "hardware", "high-speed", "human resource", "human resource management", "human resources", "human resources management", "ict", "images", "implementation period", "implementation resources", "industry standards", "information exchange", "information flows", "information security", "information system", "information technology", "innovation", "institutional capacity", "institutional development", "interfaces", "internal controls", "interoperability", "intervention", "interventions", "inventory", "inventory management", "knowledge sharing", "learning", "legal basis", "legislative framework", "licenses", "management accounting", "management information systems", "material", "monitoring mechanisms", "networks", "next generation", "number of users", "open source software", "open-source software", "payment system", "payment systems", "peer review", "pem", "performance indicators", "political leadership", "present value", "private sector", "private sector development", "procurement", "procurement processes", "programs", "project management", "public access", "public administration", "publishing", "queries", "relational databases", "reliability", "result", "results", "scanning", "server", "servers", "sites", "social development", "software development", "software packages", "software solution", "software solutions", "subsidiary", "supervision", "system design", "system development", "system requirements", "targets", "technical aspects", "technical assistance", "technical infrastructure", "technical requirements", "technological advances", "technology architecture", "technology infrastructure", "telecommunications", "telecommunications infrastructure", "telephone", "transaction", "transaction processing", "transition economies", "usability", "user", "users", "verification", "web", "web portal", "web publishing", "web site"], "pubtype": ["A World Bank study"], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2297/616400PUB0Fina1351B0Extop0ID0187500.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2297/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2297", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:03:33Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2296": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2296/616390PUB0Acco1351B0Extop0ID0185050.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2296/616390PUB0Acco1351B0Extop0ID0185050.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Accountability through Public Opinion : From Inertia to Public Action", "abstract": "This book contains a compilation of contributions to a workshop in November 2007, \"Generating Genuine Demand with Social Accountability Mechanisms,\" held in Paris, France, as well as specially commissioned articles and case studies from experts from development practice and academia.This publication is divided into eight sections: foundations;

This book brings relevant experience from both developed and developing countries to bear on issues confronting today's governments in linking with their diaspora. The chapters present different approaches used by countries that have tried to maximize the possible gains from migration by engaging more comprehensively with different diaspora groups and individuals. Some African countries are pursuing policies to develop links with Africans abroad, either to encourage them to return or to use their skills, knowledge, or financial capital to foster African development. The book discusses concrete examples of diaspora initiatives that are being implemented in Africa. There are comprehensive reviews on how the diaspora can promote trade and investment linkages. Some developing countries are using dual citizenship to deepen ties with their diaspora. The book directly addresses the issues of remittances-linked financial instruments, investments by the diaspora, diaspora bonds, contributions of skilled and unskilled diaspora in transferring knowledge, analytical research on return migration, and concrete circular migration experiences. There is a need to have a better understanding of these initiatives and to see whether they can be scaled up or replicated in other countries worldwide.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2295",

"abstract": "This report's objective is to develop the evidence base for policy making in relation to poverty reduction. It produces a diagnosis of the broad nature of the poverty problem and its trends in India, focusing on both consumption poverty and human development outcomes. It also includes attention in greater depth to three pathways important to inclusive growth and poverty reduction harnessing the potential of urban growth to stimulate rural-based poverty reduction, rural diversification away from agriculture, and tackling social exclusion. This report shows that urban growth, which has increasingly outpaced growth in rural areas, has helped to reduce poverty for urban residents directly. In addition, evidence appears of a much stronger link from urban economic growth to rural poverty reduction. Stronger links with rural poverty are due to a more integrated economy. Urban areas are a demand hub for rural producers, as well as a source of employment for the rural labor force. They are aiding the transformation of the rural economy out of agriculture. In urban areas, it is small and medium-size towns, rather than large cities, that appear to demonstrate the strongest urban-rural growth links. Urban growth also stimulates rural-urban migration. But although some increase in such migration has occurred over time, migration levels in India remain relatively low compared to other countries.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2299",

Among the ones that have done so, China stands out. Its gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate, which averaged almost 10 percent between 1978 and 2008, is unmatched. Even more remarkable is the performance of China's three leading industrial regions: the Bohai region, the Pearl River Delta, and the Yangtze River (Changjiang) delta area. These regions have averaged growth rates well above 11 percent since 1985. Shanghai is the urban axis of the Yangtze River Delta's thriving economy; Beijing is the hinge of the Bohai region. Their performance and that of a handful of other urban regions will determine China's economic fortunes and innovativeness in the coming decades. The balance of this volume is divided into five chapters. Chapter two encapsulates the sources of China's growth and the current and future role of urban regions in China. The case for the continuing substantial presence of manufacturing industry for growth and innovation in the two urban centers is made in chapter three. Chapter four briefly examines the economic transformation of four global cities and distills stylized trends that can inform future development in Beijing and Shanghai. Chapter five describes the industrial structure of the two cities, identifies promising industrial areas, and analyzes the resource base that would underpin growth fueled by innovation. Finally, chapter six suggests how strategy could be reoriented on the basis of the lessons delineated in chapter four and the economic capabilities presented in chapter five.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2402", "subjectTags": ["accounting", "agriculture", "autonomy", "balance of payments", "banks", "biotechnology", "business models", "business purposes", "business services", "buyers", "capabilities", "capability", "capital goods", "capital investments", "carbon", "carbon emissions", "certain extent", "cities", "city size", "collaboration", "commerce", "commodities", "commodity", "communication technology", "comparative advantage", "comparative advantages", "competitiveness", "computers", "connectivity", "consolidation", "consumers", "copyright", "deficits", "demonstration effects", "developed countries", "development economics", "development policies", "development strategy", "diminishing returns", "distribution of income", "dividends", "e-mail", "economic activities", "economic analysis", "economic development", "economic growth", "economic objectives", "economic performance", "economic structure", "economics research", "economists", "empirical research", "engineers", "enterprise sector", "entrepreneurship", "environmental", "environmental quality", "environments", "equipment", "expenditures", "export market", "exports", "financial crises", "financial crisis", "financial institutions", "financial markets", "financial sector", "financial services", "fishing", "foreign direct investment", "foreign investment", "foreign trade", "forestry", "gdp", "global market", "global markets", "globalization", "gross domestic product", "gross value", "growth rate", "growth strategy", "health services", "human capital", "ict", "industrial base", "industrial economies", "industrial economy", "industrial enterprises", "industrial production", "industrial regions", "industrial structure", "industrialization", "inflation", "information technology", "information technology industry", "innovation", "innovation programs", "innovations", "input use", "institution", "institutional capacity", "insurance", "intellectual capital", "intellectual property", "intellectual property protection", "intensive growth", "intermediate inputs", "international business", "international comparison", "international competitiveness", "invention", "investment spending", "ip", "joint venture", "knowledge economy", "knowledge workers", "labor force", "labor markets", "lan", "land use", "large cities", "laws", "learning", "legal infrastructure", "legal system", "licenses", "literacy", "local governments", "manufacturing", "manufacturing industries", "manufacturing industry", "material", "media", "medicine", "medium enterprises", "metropolitan areas", "monopolies", "municipal governments", "national income", "natural resource", "natural sciences", "networks", "new entrants", "new technologies", "oil", "oil prices", "patents", "pc", "per capita income", "personal computer", "physical infrastructure", "policy makers", "policy support", "positive effects", "private sector", "procurement", "producers", "product development", "productivity", "productivity growth", "productivity increases", "profit margins", "profitability", "protectionism", "queries", "r&d", "recycling", "research centers", "research infrastructure", "resource mobilization", "result", "retail outlets", "retail trade", "savings", "science foundation", "scientists", "securities", "semiconductor", "server", "service providers", "social sciences", "subsidiary", "sustainable growth", "targets", "taxation", "technicians", "technological change", "technological innovation", "technological innovations", "technological progress", "technology development", "technology transfer", "technology transfers", "telephone", "total factor productivity", "trade barriers", "transport", "unemployment", "urban development", "urban economy", "urban growth", "urbanization", "user", "users", "uses", "value added", "value chains", "wan", "wealth", "world trade", "wto"], "pubtype": [], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2402/527060JAPANESE0gon0Heads000Japanese.pdf.jpg?sequence=13", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2402/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2402", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:32:41Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2395": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2395/524540PUB0Bioe101Official0Use0Only1.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2395/524540PUB0Bioe101Official0Use0Only1.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Bioenergy Development : Issues and Impacts for Poverty and Natural Resource Management", "abstract": "These report overviews recent developments in the consumption and production of bioenergy. It examines the main issues and possible economic implications of these developments and assesses their potential impact on land use and the environment, especially with respect to forests. The report examines both solid biomass and liquid biofuels, identifying opportunities and challenges at the regional and country levels. The development of bioenergy presents both opportunities and challenges for economic development and the environment. It is likely to have significant impacts on the forest sector, directly, through the use of wood for energy production, and indirectly, as a result of changes in land use. The impact of bioenergy on poverty alleviation in developing countries will depend on the opportunities for agricultural development, including income and employment generation, the potential to increase poor peoples' access to improved types of bioenergy; and the effects on energy and food prices. Five main messages emerge from this report: solid biomass will continue to be a principal source of energy; developments in bioenergy will have major implications for land use; tradeoffs, including those related to poverty, equity, and the environment, must be evaluated when choosing a bioenergy system; there is considerable potential for making greater use of forestry and timber waste as a bioenergy feedstock; and the climate benefits of bioenergy development are uncertain and highly location and feedstock specific.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2395", "subjectTags":

Where, Why, and for How Much?", "abstract": "The Government of Rwanda has identified human resources for health as one of its Policy priorities. This study aims to contribute to building a better understanding of health worker choice and behavior, and to improve evidence based policies. The work was undertaken by The Ministry of Health in a collaborative effort with the World Bank, building on the results of qualitative pre research, and is the first wave of a cohort survey with medical and nursing students. In comparison with other African countries, migration of health workers abroad may be less of a problem for Rwanda. The study finds that 80 percent of nursing and medical students report to have no intention to migrate abroad in the coming five years. Using a contingent valuation method to measure the reservation wage to migrate, we find that at the current public sector starting salary more than half the students will choose a job in Kigali instead of going abroad. But there is considerable heterogeneity in the willingness to work abroad. For example, students who are married or engaged are less likely to move abroad. Younger medical students require a higher average salary to stay in Rwanda compared to older students. Although Rwanda has a relatively low HIV prevalence compared to other African countries, there are problems with attitudes to HIV/AIDS, although the attitudes differ greatly between students, with medical students consistently more positive than nurses. Medical students score higher than nurses on medical knowledge related to HIV/AIDS, have higher levels of self reported knowledge on AIDS, and are also more familiar with HIV. Health students are generally averse to taking up work in high HIV prevalence areas but preferences vary widely, as is reflected in the wide span of reservation wages to accept a job in a high HIV prevalence area. Students are less willing to work in high HIV prevalence areas than to take up rural service.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2445", "subjectTags": ["absenteeism", "access to schooling", "accreditation", "age groups", "career", "career choice", "career choices", "career prospects", "curricula", "degrees", "disease", "employment", "expenditures", "female students", "health care", "health education", "health outcomes", "health services", "health workers", "health workforce", "hiv", "hiv infection", "hiv positive", "hiv/aids", "human development", "human resources", "immune deficiency", "immunodeficiency", "infection", "infection rate", "interventions", "job satisfaction", "life expectancy", "literature", "malaria", "medical care", "medical doctors", "medical faculty", "medical school", "medical students", "medicine", "mental health", "mental health nursing", "midwifery", "migration", "mortality", "nurses", "nursing", "nursing schools", "nursing students", "papers", "patient", "patients", "post secondary education", "prevalence", "printing", "public health", "rooms", "schools", "skilled labor", "subjects", "syndrome", "teachers", "test scores", "tuition", "tuition fees", "virus", "vision", "work environment", "work experience", "work force", "workers"], "pubtype": ["World Bank working paper ; no. 189.

Under the new paradigm, a centralized Information and communication technology (ICT) platform will be established to serve the microfinance industry of Bangladesh and technology will be deployed more rapidly to Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) in all parts of the microfinance value chain, from the head office to branch offices, loan officers, and clients. Unlike in the traditional paradigm, the technology needs of all MFIs will be pooled together in one central office. The central office will offer technology tools, services, and know-how to MFIs throughout the country. Several benefits will be achieved under this new paradigm: i) because all technology needs will be pooled in one place, the central office will be able to exploit economies of scale and offer technology services to MFIs at a lower cost; and ii) because their technology needs will be outsourced, MFI staff will no longer need to devote as much time and effort to learning new technologies.

The first person may describe a fenced-in industrial estate in a developing country, populated by footloose multinational corporations (MNCs) enjoying tax breaks, with laborers in garment factories working in substandard conditions. In contrast, the second person may recount the 'miracle of Shenzhen,' a fishing village transformed into a cosmopolitan city of 14 million, with per capita gross domestic product (GDP) growing 100-fold, in the 30 years since it was designated as an SEZ. A third person may think about places like Dubai or Singapore, whose ports serve as the basis for wide range of trade- and logistics-oriented activities. In this book, the author use SEZ as a generic expression to describe the broad range of modern economic zones discussed in this book. But we are most concerned with two specific forms of those zones: (1) the export processing zones (EPZs) or free zones, which focus on manufacturing for export; and (2) the large-scale SEZs, which usually combine residential and multiuse commercial and industrial activity. The former represents a traditional model used widely throughout the developing world for almost four decades. The latter represents a more recent form of economic zone, originating in the 1980s in China and gaining in popularity in recent years. Although these models need not be mutually exclusive (many SEZs include EPZ industrial parks within them), they are sufficiently different in their objectives, investment requirements, and approach to require a distinction in this book.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2341", "subjectTags": ["accounting", "administrative procedures", "agriculture", "arbitrage", "barrier", "benefit analysis", "business environment", "carbon", "carbon dioxide", "carbon dioxide emissions", "civil war", "clean development mechanism", "climate change", "coal", "commodities", "common market", "communication technology", "comparative advantage", "competitive advantage", "competitiveness", "copyright clearance", "copyright clearance center", "corporate tax", "corporate taxes", "critical infrastructure", "customs union", "deposit", "developing countries", "developing country", "developing economies", "development policy", "dividend", "dividend tax", "domestic economy", "domestic investors", "domestic market", "double taxation", "economic activity", "economic analysis", "economic benefits", "economic change", "economic cooperation", "economic crisis", "economic development", "economic efficiency", "economic growth", "economic implications", "economic integration", "economic outcomes", "economic reform", "economic reforms", "economic strategies", "economic structures", "economic value", "economics", "economies of scale", "economists", "emission reduction", "empirical research", "employment opportunities", "environmental", "environmental impact", "environmental impacts", "environmental issues", "environmental policy", "environmental standards", "environmental sustainability", "environments", "epz", "export markets", "export processing zone", "export processing zones", "export sector", "female employment", "finance corporation", "financial services", "financial support", "fishing", "foreign currency", "foreign direct investment", "foreign exchange", "foreign investment", "foreign investments", "foreign investor", "foreign investors", "foreign labor", "foreign ownership", "foreign workers", "formal economy", "free trade", "free trade agreement", "gdp", "global economy", "global exports", "global markets", "globalization", "gross domestic product", "gross value", "group of investors", "growth policies", "harmonization", "income", "income tax", "industrial countries", "industrialization", "infrastructure investments", "innovation", "innovations", "instrument", "insurance", "intellectual property", "international bank", "international cooperation", "international development", "international finance", "international labour organization", "international market", "international markets", "international trade", "investment climate", "investment climate reform", "investment policy", "investor protection", "job creation", "joint ventures", "labor costs", "labor force", "labor market", "labor market rigidities", "labor markets", "labor productivity", "labor standards", "laborers", "labour", "legal framework", "liberalization", "marginal cost", "market access", "market demand", "market economies", "market factors", "middle-income countries", "minimum wage", "multilateral trade", "multinational corporation", "multinational corporations", "national economy", "natural resources", "negative externalities", "outsourcing", "ownership structure", "policy environment", "policy makers", "policy response", "political cycles", "political economy", "political process", "portfolio", "positive externalities", "post office", "preferential access", "private investment", "private sector development", "private sector investors", "producers", "production costs", "property rights", "provident fund", "public-private partnership", "purchasing power", "quotas", "rapid expansion", "rapid growth", "real estate", "real wages", "regional integration", "regional trade", "regulatory authorities", "regulatory constraints", "regulatory environment", "regulatory environments", "regulatory framework", "regulatory frameworks", "rents", "reputation", "risk management", "security concerns", "semiskilled workers", "skilled labor", "skilled workers", "social cost", "structural change", "suppliers", "sustainable development", "tax", "tax breaks", "tax rate", "technology transfer", "total factor productivity", "trade association", "turnover", "unemployment", "unfair competition", "unskilled workers", "value added", "wages", "work force", "working conditions", "world trade", "world trade organization", "wto"], "pubtype": ["Directions in Development ;

It considers both country and regional level approaches for tackling NCDs, as many of the issues and challenges of mounting an effective response are common to most South Asian countries. The prevention and control of NCDs constitute a development issue that low-income countries in South Asia are already facing. Both country and regional-level strategies are important because many of the issues and challenges of mounting an effective response to NCDs are common to most South Asian countries, even though their disease burden profiles vary. Hence, the rationale for this book is that strategic decisions for prevention and treatment of NCDs can effectively address the future burden of disease, promote healthy aging, and increase the potential benefit from the demographic transition, thus contributing to economic development.

The world is facing an unprecedented rate of species extinction: one in eight bird species, one in four mammals, and one in three amphibians are threatened. Species can recover with concerted conservation. As a charismatic endangered species, tigers have become a powerful symbol of biodiversity loss globally, as their numbers have dropped from 100,000 at the turn of the 20th century to an estimated 3,000-3,500 tigers in the wild today. The need to protect tigers has taken on great urgency, and international efforts are attempting to pull them back from the edge of extinction. From November 21 to 24, 2010, the Russian Federation hosted leaders from 13 tiger range countries at a conference in St. Petersburg. The goal was inter alia to eliminate illegal trade in tiger parts while protecting tiger habitats and to double the tiger population by 2022. The World Bank has provided strong leadership and support for the initiative. Biodiversity interventions can have potentially large co benefits: biodiversity conservation, climate change stabilization, food and water security, and poverty reduction. The World Bank has been the largest financier for biodiversity, with commitments of more than $2 billion over the last two decades and substantial leveraging of co financing. However, the number of new projects approved that contain biodiversity activities has dropped considerably since the mid-2000s. At present, the Bank is according importance to biodiversity by taking a leading role in strategic partnerships, such as the Global Tiger Initiative (GTI), the Critical Ecosystems Partnership Fund (CEPF), and the Save Our Species (SOS) program. By prioritizing such initiatives, the Bank aims to bring crucial attention and funding to ecosystem and biodiversity conservation. It is also crucial at the same time to integrate conservation in development projects in sectors such as infrastructure and rural development, which can have negative effects on biodiversity without adequate mitigating actions. This review has shown that as important as these targeted biodiversity efforts is the need for the Bank, countries, and partners to strengthen efforts to integrate biodiversity conservation into projects in sectors where they can have negative biodiversity impacts without mitigating actions, such as rural transport, watershed management, or integrated rural development.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2344", "subjectTags": ["action plan", "action plans", "adaptive management", "adverse environmental impacts", "adverse impacts", "aerial surveys", "agricultural encroachment", "alternative livelihoods", "amphibians", "animal", "animal species", "animals", "assessment methods", "baseline conditions", "baseline data", "baseline studies", "biodiversity", "biodiversity activities", "biodiversity conservation", "biodiversity conservation efforts", "biodiversity conservation projects", "biodiversity experts", "biodiversity impacts", "biodiversity indices", "biodiversity loss", "biodiversity project", "biological diversity", "biological resources", "bird", "bird species", "black market", "breeding", "buffer zones", "burning", "climate change", "colonization", "complements", "concession management", "conservation", "conservation efforts", "conservation landscapes", "conservation measures", "conservation of biodiversity", "conservation of biological diversity", "conservation of nature", "conservation of tigers", "conservation programs", "conservation projects", "conservation value", "conserve biodiversity", "conserving biodiversity", "convention on international trade in endangered species", "core areas", "crimes", "critical ecosystem", "critical ecosystems", "critical natural habitat", "critical natural habitats", "cultural importance", "decision support systems", "deforestation", "ecological conditions", "ecological data", "ecological functions", "ecological processes", "ecological services", "economic development", "ecosystem services", "ecosystems", "effective conservation", "encroachment", "endangered species", "engineers", "environmental concerns", "environmental conditions", "environmental degradation", "environmental guidelines", "environmental impact", "environmental impact assessment", "environmental management", "environmental protection", "evolution", "extinction", "fauna", "flora", "foot patrols", "forest", "forest concession", "forest loss", "forest protection", "forests", "gis", "habitat conditions", "habitat conservation", "habitat destruction", "habitat fragmentation", "habitat loss", "hedges", "hot spots", "hotels", "hotspots", "human pressures", "hunters", "hunting", "illegal logging", "illegal poaching", "illegal trade", "indicator species", "integrated development", "integrated rural development", "interventions", "issues", "key indicator species", "key indicators", "landscape", "legally protected areas", "local communities", "long-term monitoring", "loss of species", "mammals", "management systems", "migratory corridors", "migratory species", "monitoring programs", "monitoring systems", "national park", "national parks", "national zoological park", "native species", "natural areas", "natural habitat", "natural habitats", "natural resource", "natural resource management", "natural resources", "natural resources management", "negative effects", "negative impacts", "plant", "plant species", "poaching", "population surveys", "prey", "prey populations", "protected areas", "protected species", "protecting natural habitats", "regional development", "regional environment", "remote sensing", "road development", "road networks", "roads", "rural development", "safety", "sedimentation", "sensitive habitats", "sensitive species", "settlement", "soil erosion", "species", "species extinction", "stewardship", "subspecies", "subspecies of tigers", "sustainable development", "swamps", "threat assessments", "threatened plants", "threats to biodiversity", "threats to tiger", "threats to tigers", "tiger", "tiger conservation", "tiger conservation efforts", "tiger habitats", "tiger poaching", "tiger population", "tiger populations", "tiger range", "tiger range countries", "tiger reserve", "tiger trade", "top predator", "tourism", "trade data", "trade in tiger parts", "transport", "trees", "types of threats", "variety", "vegetation", "vegetative cover", "viable populations", "villages", "water drainage", "watershed", "watershed management", "wild fauna", "wild tiger", "wild tiger populations", "wild tigers", "wilderness", "wildlands", "wildlife", "wildlife conservation", "wildlife crime", "wildlife populations", "wildlife protection", "wildlife reserves", "wildlife trade"], "pubtype": ["Evaluation Brief ;

It focuses on the role of auctions of electricity contracts designed to expand and retain existing generation capacity. It is not meant to be a 'how-to' manual. Rather, it highlights some major issues and options that need to be taken into account when a country considers moving towards competitive electricity procurement through the introduction of electricity auctions. Auctions have played an important role in the effort to match supply and demand. Ever since the 1990s, the use of long-term contract auctions to procure new generation capacity, notably from private sector suppliers, has garnered increased affection from investors, governments, and multilateral agencies in general, as a means to achieve a competitive and transparent procurement process while providing certainty of supply for the medium to long term. However, the liberalization of electricity markets and the move from single-buyer procurement models increased the nature of the challenge facing system planners in their efforts to ensure an adequate and secure supply of electricity in the future at the best price. While auctions as general propositions are a means to match supply with demand in a cost-effective manner, they can also be and have been used to meet a variety of goals.", "uri":

Current policy debates are devoted almost exclusively to border control and policing; they pay only lip service to local and regional developmental strategies. This volume takes a different approach. Its contributors are scholars who are convinced that empirically based policy making stands a better chance of succeeding than untested preconceptions that risk reproducing recipes that have failed elsewhere. The book is therefore strong on empirics, providing a wealth of original data. It also reframes existing approaches and reexamines secondary data from fresh perspectives. Although the focus remains South Africa, the book reflects South Africa's regional role and draws on data from across the Southern African Development Community (SADC). This book broadens the 'migration' agenda beyond the boundaries of migration studies and migration policy silos.

The report identifies lessons and good practice examples that warrant further examination and wider dissemination. First, the study confirms the desirability of continued selective lending in a few focus states. The Bank's engagement with progressive, reformist states has added value and has been highly appreciated, but to enhance the poverty impact of state-level interventions, greater weight should be given to the needs of the poorest states by balancing states' propensity to reform and the concentration of poverty within them. Experience shows that it has been possible to achieve results in some of the poorer, low-capacity states through persistent work with committed state counterparts and partnerships with other donors. Second, continued focus on public finance management appears sound, irrespective of whether engagement is confined to this area or serves as an entry point for broader engagement.

It has been more than 25 years since the discovery of HIV, but no scientific study has provided a comprehensive data-driven synthesis of HIV/AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) infectious spread in this region. The current report provides the first comprehensive scientific assessment and data-driven epidemiological synthesis of HIV spread in MENA since the beginning of the epidemic. It is based on a literature review and analysis of thousands of widely unrecognized publications, reports, and data sources extracted from scientific literature or collected from sources at the local, national, and regional levels. The recommendations provided here focus on key strategies related to the scope of this report and its emphasis on understanding HIV epidemiology in MENA as a whole. The recommendations are based on identifying the status of the HIV epidemic in MENA, through this synthesis, as a low HIV prevalence setting with rising concentrated epidemics among priority populations. General directions for prevention interventions as warranted by the outcome of this synthesis are also discussed briefly, but are not delineated because they are beyond the scope of this report.

Chapter three discusses the key features of labor markets in South Asia, including where the better jobs are, who holds them, and the implications for the employment challenge ahead. Chapter four reviews the business environment constraints affecting, in particular, those firms that have expanded employment and discusses policy options for overcoming the most binding business constraints in South Asia. Chapter five analyzes the dimensions of the education and a skill challenge in the region and discusses policy priorities for improving the quality and skills of graduates of education and training systems. Chapter six reviews the role of labor market policies and institutions in encouraging job creation and protecting workers in the formal and informal economy and discusses possible directions for labor market policies, including options to increase the access of informal sector workers to programs that help them manage labor market shocks and improve their future earnings potential.

Although the labor force has become more educated, and this trend is particularly marked for youth, the main source of employment for both youth and adults remains the informal sector. Moreover, the importance of the informal sector as a source of employment has increased since the mid-1990s. On the positive side, unemployment declined in last decades, particularly for youth. The Sri Lankan government has continually acted on various fronts to address the youth unemployment problem. It has tried to improve and modernize Sri Lanka's general education system, which has long been criticized as too academic, and to increase the accessibility of training so as to promote the employability youth leaving school. Other actions included strengthening entrepreneurship programs and introducing career guidance and counseling and improving labor market information to help young people in their job searches and to guide human resource planning. In 2007, the government developed the National Action Plan for youth employment, built, for the first time, on a coherent youth employment policy framework and deriving an encompassing and consistent set of policy recommendations. The plan was based on in-depth analysis of Sri Lanka's labor market, provided via a series of background papers undertaken under the auspices of the Youth Employment Network (YEN). To provide the richness and comprehensiveness of this analysis in its totality, these papers, updated and revised, are collected in the present book. This book offers a wealth of valuable advice to the government and other stakeholders to achieve this goal. By exploiting the full potential of the youth, not only will their talent, aspirations, and energy be harnessed to advance economic growth, but also the existing inequities will be reduced and, hopefully in the longer run, eliminated.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2451", "subjectTags": ["accounting", "active labor", "active labor market", "active labor market programs", "age group", "age groups", "apprenticeship", "bargaining", "bargaining power", "bulletin", "capacity building", "civil conflict", "civil unrest", "climate change", "consumer price index", "counselling", "development economics", "discrimination", "displacement", "dissemination", "domestic workers", "dropouts", "economic growth", "educational attainment", "educational opportunity", "educational qualifications", "employability", "employee", "employment creation", "employment growth", "employment opportunities", "employment patterns", "employment policy", "employment prospects", "employment protection legislation", "employment status", "equal opportunity", "existing inequities", "export processing zone", "feminist", "finding work", "formal sector workers", "gender disparities", "gender equality", "gross domestic product", "high unemployment", "high unemployment rates", "high wages", "human capital", "human development", "human resource", "human resource development", "human resources", "income", "income distribution", "income support", "industrial development", "inexperienced workers", "informal employment", "informal sector", "innovation", "international cooperation", "international migration", "job counseling", "job creation", "job destruction", "job market", "job placement", "job placement service", "job search", "job searches", "job security", "job seekers", "job skills", "job training", "job vacancies", "jobs", "labor allocation", "labor costs", "labor economics", "labor force", "labor force growth", "labor force participation", "labor force population", "labor laws", "labor market", "labor market efficiency", "labor market indicators", "labor market information", "labor market institutions", "labor market issues", "labor market outcomes", "labor market policies", "labor market segmentation", "labor markets", "labor resources", "labour", "labour relations", "legal status", "level of education", "living standards", "manpower", "marital status", "mathematics", "migrant", "migrant labor", "millennium declaration", "mother", "national action", "national action plan", "national committee", "natural resource", "nutrition", "occupation", "older workers", "policy analysis", "policy framework", "policy implications", "policy makers", "political economy", "population trends", "practitioners", "primary education", "primary level", "private sector", "private sector job", "private sector workers", "productive employment", "productive work", "productivity", "productivity growth", "productivity growth rates", "proportional hazard model", "provident funds", "public sector jobs", "public sector workers", "retail trade", "rural development", "salaried employment", "salaried workers", "semiskilled labor", "service sector", "severance pay", "sex", "skilled workers", "skilled workforce", "skills development", "small businesses", "social conditions", "social development", "social inclusion", "social policies", "social policy", "social science", "social sciences", "sociocultural environment", "suitable employment", "technical education", "technical training", "teenagers", "television", "tertiary education", "total employment", "total labor force", "total unemployment", "trade unions", "training institutions", "training programs", "unemployed", "unemployed adults", "unemployed persons", "unemployed population", "unemployed youth", "unemployment duration", "unemployment insurance", "unemployment levels", "unemployment problem", "unemployment rate", "unemployment rates", "unpaid family workers", "unskilled workers", "violence", "vocational programs", "vocational training", "vocational training programs", "wage determination", "wage differentials", "wage employment", "wage gap", "wage inequality", "well-functioning labor market", "white-collar occupations", "work experience", "work force", "worker", "workers", "working conditions", "young adults", "young people", "young women", "young workers", "youth access", "youth employment", "youth labor", "youth participation", "youth population", "youth services", "youth unemployment", "youth unemployment rate", "youth unrest"], "pubtype": ["Direction in Development ;

The objective of the Eco2 cities initiative is to help cities in developing countries achieve a greater degree of ecological and economic sustainability. The book is divided into three parts. Part one describes the Eco2 cities initiative framework. It describes the approach, beginning with the background and rationale. Key challenges are described, and lessons are drawn from cities that have managed to turn these challenges into opportunities. A set of four key principles is introduced. These principles are the foundation upon which the initiative is built. They are: (1) a city-based approach enabling local governments to lead a development process that takes into account their specific circumstances, including their local ecology; (2) an expanded platform for collaborative design and decision making that accomplishes sustained synergy by coordinating and aligning the actions of key stakeholders; (3) a one-system approach that enables cities to realize the benefits of integration by planning, designing, and managing the whole urban system; and (4) an investment framework that values sustainability and resiliency by incorporating and accounting for life-cycle analysis, the value of all capital assets, and a broader scope for risk assessment in decision making. Part two presents a city-based decision support system that introduces core methods and tools to help cities as they work toward applying some of the core elements and stepping stones. Part two looks into methods for collaborative design and decision making and methods to create an effective long-term framework able to help align policies and the actions of stakeholders. Part three consists of the Field Reference Guide. The guide contains background literature designed to support cities in developing more in-depth insight and fluency with the issues at two levels. It provides a city-by-city and sector-by-sector lens on urban infrastructure.

Long the ideal of many scholars and observers of urban problems, such a system may now be close to realization. In this book, examples of Latin American cities are used as case studies. As argued in the first chapter, there are good reasons to concentrate on Latin America: it is the world region with the most rapid urban development and is the most urbanized region in the developing world. In contrast to residents of cities in poorer regions, Latin Americans have managed to democratize homeownership and to extend basic services to the majority of households. That means that improving the Quality of Life (QoL) in Latin American cities is no longer primarily a matter of bricks and mortar. But the challenges are as large as they are diverse. Chapter two introduces the reader to the hedonic price and the life satisfaction approaches and presents a comparative summary of the conclusions of the six case studies. This chapter, like the first, is essential for the policy maker or activist in urban affairs who wants to understand the possibilities of the new systems for monitoring the quality of urban life. Chapter three is a concise and self-contained introduction to the economic theory on which the hedonic pricing and life satisfaction approaches are based and which forms the backbone of this book.

In 1986, the International Labor Organization's (ILO's) database reported 176 zones in 47 countries; by 2006, it reported 3,500 zones in 130 countries. This huge growth occurred despite many zones having failed to meet their objectives; however, many others are contributing significantly to growth in foreign direct investment (FDI), exports, and employment, as well as playing a catalytic role in integration into global trade and structural transformation, including industrialization and upgrading. This study aims to address some of these questions and deliver an analysis that is both data-driven and policy-focused. The objective of the study is to explore the experience of zone programs, with a particular focus on Sub-Saharan Africa, to understand the factors that contribute to static and dynamic outcomes. It aims to provide input to the question of whether and how zones can make a significant contribution to job creation, diversification, and sustainable growth in African and other low-income countries.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2268", "subjectTags": ["administrative procedures", "advanced economies", "agriculture", "arbitrage", "benchmark", "benchmarking", "binding constraints", "bond", "business environment", "business process outsourcing", "capacity building", "capital development", "catalytic impact", "catalytic role", "cities", "collaboration", "commodities", "common market", "communication technology", "comparative advantage", "comparative advantages", "competitive environment", "competitiveness", "connectivity", "consumers", "copyright clearance", "copyright clearance center", "corporate tax", "country to country", "customs union", "data collection", "decentralization", "demographic", "developing countries", "development economics", "development policies", "displacement", "domestic economies", "domestic economy", "domestic investors", "domestic market", "domestic markets", "economic analysis", "economic benefits", "economic change", "economic cooperation", "economic crisis", "economic development", "economic growth", "economic impact", "economic liberalization", "economic outcomes", "economic reform", "economic reforms", "economic research", "economic strategies", "economic value", "economics", "economies of scale", "economists", "emerging economies", "environmental", "environmental policy", "environmental standards", "environments", "epz", "export growth", "export markets", "export processing zone", "export processing zones", "exports", "external trade", "finance corporation", "financial support", "fishing", "foreign capital", "foreign direct investment", "foreign exchange", "foreign investment", "foreign investors", "foreign ownership", "foreign trade", "foreign value", "free trade", "free trade agreement", "future research", "gdp", "generalized system of preferences", "global economy", "global investors", "global markets", "global standards", "globalization", "gross domestic product", "guarantee of success", "human capital", "income", "incomes", "industrial development", "industrialization", "information technology", "innovations", "international cooperation", "international finance", "international labour organization", "international trade", "investment climate", "investment policies", "investment policy", "investors confidence", "job creation", "joint venture", "knowledge sharing", "labor costs", "labor force", "labor market", "labor market rigidities", "labor markets", "labor productivity", "labor standards", "labour", "learning", "legal framework", "liberalization", "low-income countries", "low-income country", "low-income economies", "market access", "middle-income country", "minimum wage", "monopolies", "monopoly", "multipliers", "national development", "national economy", "natural resource", "negative externalities", "oil", "output", "outsourcing", "ownership structure", "policy decisions", "policy environment", "policy instruments", "policy makers", "political economy", "power outages", "ppps", "present value", "private investment", "private sector development", "privatization", "production process", "production processes", "programs", "public-private partnership", "public-private partnerships", "rapid growth", "real estate", "regional integration", "regional trade", "regulatory agency", "regulatory authorities", "regulatory authority", "regulatory environment", "regulatory framework", "regulatory frameworks", "regulatory regime", "regulatory regimes", "remote region", "research agenda", "safety", "skilled workers", "social values", "streams", "structural change", "suppliers", "sustainable growth", "taxation", "technical assistance", "technical needs", "technology transfer", "technology transfers", "telecommunications", "trade policy", "trade unions", "trades", "trading activities", "trading platform", "transaction costs", "transparency", "unemployment", "unskilled labor", "value added", "wages", "wealth", "working conditions", "world trade", "world trade organization", "wto"], "pubtype": ["Directions in Development ;

Through the specific use of mobile money (m-money) services, for example, customers have accessed informational services, such as balance inquiries in their bank accounts, and transactional services, such as sending remittances to other people or paying for goods and services via their mobile phones. M-money has also been used by national governments to pay employee salaries and benefits. A key objective of this report is to discourage use of informal systems through the creation of a proportionate and not overly burdensome regulatory framework. Overly restrictive identification and verification processes in know-your-customer (KYC) policies, for example, may push users back to the informal financial system. The evolution of m-money in Africa and in non-African, low-income countries means that low-income and low-capacity countries are grappling with ways to ensure compliance with international Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) standards. Thus, this report also provides some indications of how the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standards can be applied to low-income clients within an m-money context.

There is increasing evidence that investments in the nutritional, cognitive, and socio-emotional development of young children have high payoffs. Researchers and development practitioners are building on this evidence to raise the topic's profile and bring it to the attention of decision makers. This volume is an important contribution to these efforts. It thoroughly and carefully reviews the most recent empirical literature linking early childhood development outcomes, poverty, and shocks. In doing so, it brings an added perspective to the debate and makes the case that investments in the first years of life have the potential to be a critical component of poverty reduction strategies. The volume also goes beyond simply documenting the consequences of insufficient or inadequate focus on early childhood and identifies the range of policy options available to policy makers. The Human Development Perspectives series seeks to present thorough research findings on issues of critical strategic importance for developing countries. At its core is the perspective that investments in human capital are an essential aspect of efforts to promote global development and eradicate poverty. This volume makes it convincingly clear that investing in and protecting the human capital of young children is no small matter.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2266", "subjectTags": ["achievement", "addiction", "age groups", "aged", "anxiety", "attention", "basic education", "brain development", "care centers", "caregivers", "child health", "child mortality", "clinics", "cognition", "cognitive development", "cognitive outcomes", "cognitive skills", "community health", "day care", "day care centers", "demand for education", "depression", "developmental potential", "donor support", "dropouts", "early child development", "early childhood", "early childhood development", "early childhood education", "early childhood interventions", "early intervention", "early interventions", "early stimulation", "ecd", "ecd policies", "ecd programs", "education programs", "educational outcomes", "enrollment", "enrollment rates", "environmental factors", "families", "gender", "gross enrollment", "gross enrollment rates", "health services", "home visits", "human development", "individual counseling", "infant mortality", "intelligence", "intervention", "interventions", "language development", "language stimulation", "learning", "learning materials", "legal status", "life cycle", "low birth weight", "malnutrition", "memory", "mental", "mental development", "migration", "morbidity", "mortality", "nutrition", "nutritional status", "orphans", "parenting", "personality", "physical growth", "pollution", "preprimary school enrollment", "preschool education", "preschool enrollment", "preschool programs", "preschools", "primary education", "primary school", "primary school education", "primary schools", "psychology", "public health", "readers", "reading", "recognition", "risk factors", "rural areas", "school readiness", "schooling", "siblings", "smoking", "social behavior", "speech", "storytelling", "universal primary education", "violence", "wages", "workers", "working memory", "young children", "youth"], "pubtype": ["Human Development Perspectives"], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2266/600410PUB0ID181Matter09780821386774.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2266/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2266", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:02:45Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2267": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2267/600390PUB0ID171Health09780821379073.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2267/600390PUB0ID171Health09780821379073.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Rethinking School Health : A Key Component of Education for All", "abstract": "Education is one of the most important drivers of the development of individuals and societies. It not only has powerful implications for the creation of human capacity, but also helps people realize their full potential and expand their connections with the world. Economic analyses repeatedly demonstrate that education gives a high economic return within the life - span of an individual and is a key factor underlying the economic growth of nations. Viewed from these perspectives, the decision at the turn of the millennium of governments and development partners to pursue the goal of Education for All (EFA) was not only an important contribution to one sector, but the launch of an endeavor with major implications for the future of humanity. The early perception of the goal of EFA was that all children should have access to education-every child should be able to exercise the right to go to school. This limited goal soon broadened to address the quality of the education that a child received at school and the factors that ensured the child was able to stay in school long enough to learn enough. These additional objectives have expanded the goal of EFA, so that it now aims to ensure that every child has the opportunity to complete an education of good quality, although definitions of quality and completeness remain under discussion. The question now is not whether school health and school feeding programs are necessary to EFA, but how they can be implemented at meaningful scale in the poorest countries, which need them the most.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2267", "subjectTags": ["academic achievement", "access to education", "adequate classrooms", "adolescents", "adults", "age groups", "aids epidemic", "anemia", "ari", "barriers to education", "basic learning", "basic learning needs", "chemotherapy", "child development", "child development programs", "child nutrition", "children with disabilities", "classroom", "classrooms", "clinics", "cognitive development", "cognitive function", "comparative education", "comprehensive school health", "conditional cash transfers", "crime", "demand for education", "dentistry", "diabetes", "diarrhea", "diet", "disabilities", "dropout rates", "early child development", "early childhood", "early childhood interventions", "eating habits", "education development", "education for all", "education for children", "education goals", "education management", "education outcomes", "education policies", "education programs", "education sector", "education strategy", "education system", "education systems", "educational access", "educational achievement", "educational attainment", "educational benefits", "educational outcomes", "educational planning", "educational quality", "effective education", "effectiveness of education", "elementary school", "enrollment", "epidemics", "equal opportunities", "family health", "family life", "family life education", "fee abolition", "folic acid", "friendly school", "friendly schools", "gender equality", "gender equity", "gender imbalances", "gender issues", "gender sensitive", "girls", "girls in education", "global education", "global initiative on education", "health education", "health interventions", "health messages", "health policy", "health providers", "health services", "health-promoting schools", "hiv/aids", "human development", "hygiene", "imbalances in education", "immunodeficiency", "infection", "infectious diseases", "intervention", "iron", "iron supplements", "knowledge sharing", "learning", "learning achievement", "learning institution", "learning materials", "learning outcomes", "life skills", "life skills education", "life-skills", "malaria", "malnutrition", "maternal and child health", "mch", "medical research", "mental health", "mental health promotion", "morbidity", "mortality", "national education", "national school", "nongovernmental organizations", "number of students", "nurses", "nutrition", "nutrition interventions", "nutrition outcomes", "nutrition program", "nutrition programs", "obesity", "oral health", "orphans", "out-of-school children", "parent-teacher association", "parity", "participation in education", "participation of parents", "pediatrics", "performance at school", "physical activity", "physical education", "poor children", "primary completion", "primary completion rate", "primary school", "primary school completion", "primary school completion rate", "primary school-age children", "primary schools", "productivity", "public health", "pupil-teacher ratio", "quality education", "quality learning", "quality schools", "repeaters", "reproductive health", "reproductive health education", "returns to education", "risk factors", "risk groups", "safe drinking water", "sanitation", "school age", "school attendance", "school children", "school curricula", "school dropout", "school environment", "school fee", "school feeding", "school feeding programs", "school fees", "school health", "school health activities", "school health education", "school health interventions", "school health programs", "school health promotion", "school health services", "school hygiene", "school meal", "school meals", "school participation", "school performance", "school program", "school system", "school-age", "school-age child", "school-age children", "schoolchildren", "schooling", "screening", "sexual abuse", "sexual health", "sexuality", "sexuality education", "sexually transmitted diseases", "skills development", "social support", "state schools", "student performance", "stunting", "teacher", "teachers", "teaching", "textbooks", "tobacco", "tobacco use", "universal basic education", "universal education", "universal primary education", "unwanted pregnancy", "violence", "vulnerable children", "workers", "young people", "youth"], "pubtype": ["Directions in Development ;

Chapter three introduces the techniques that practitioners may use to trace assets and analyze financial data, as well as to secure reliable and admissible evidence for asset confiscation cases. The provisional measures and planning necessary to secure the assets prior to confiscation are discussed in chapter four; and chapter five introduces some of the management issues that practitioners will need to consider during this phase. Confiscation systems are the focus of chapter six, including a review of the different systems and how they operate and the procedural enhancements that are available in some jurisdictions. On the issue of international cooperation, chapter seven reviews the various methods available, including informal assistance and mutual legal assistance requests; and guides practitioners through the entire process. Finally, chapters eight and nine discuss two additional avenues for asset recovery-respectively, civil proceedings and domestic confiscation proceedings undertaken in foreign jurisdictions.", "uri":

It is largely based on the fourth round of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD)-World Bank Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Surveys (BEEPS) covering over 11,000 firms in 29 countries in Europe and Central Asia (ECA). The report provides an update of the progress that ECA countries have made since 2005, extends (in certain respects) the analysis of corruption and regulatory burden on firms provided in the earlier Anticorruption in Transition (ACT) reports covering the period from 1999 to 2005, and in several instances provides comparisons of ECA countries to similar countries outside of the region using the World Bank enterprise surveys and other sources of data. Despite making significant progress on administrative bribery overall, corruption is cited more frequently by firms in the region as an obstacle to doing business than any other problem, with the exception of tax rates. In part, this continued perception of corruption as one of the most serious problems for business may reflect slower progress on other aspects of corruption not measured directly in firm-state interactions covered by the BEEPS.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2265", "subjectTags": ["access to financing", "accountability", "administrative costs", "administrative procedures", "advertising", "anti-corruption", "anticorruption", "bribe", "bribery", "bribes", "business climate", "business environment", "business indicator", "business indicators", "business interactions", "business regulation", "business services", "businesses", "capacity building", "certificates", "chapter 7", "complaints", "convictions", "copyright", "corrupt", "corrupt practices", "corruption", "corruption laws", "court decisions", "court performance", "court system", "credibility", "crime", "customs", "democracies", "e-mail", "electricity", "enforcement of laws", "enterprise survey", "enterprise surveys", "fair competition", "foreign ownership", "foreign trade", "global competitiveness", "government contract", "government contracts", "government officials", "government policies", "government regulation", "government regulations", "graft", "grand corruption", "illegal payments", "image", "information technology", "initiative", "inspection", "inspections", "integrity", "international standards", "international trade", "judgment", "judicial decisions", "judicial institutions", "judicial system", "judicial systems", "judiciary", "kickback", "kickbacks", "lan", "large firms", "legal frameworks", "license", "licenses", "manufacturing", "manufacturing industry", "market access", "market economies", "material", "media", "mentoring", "nepotism", "operating environment", "patronage", "perception of corruption", "politicians", "private sector", "privatization", "procurement", "procurement law", "procurement laws", "procurement procedures", "property rights", "public administration", "public funds", "public information", "public officials", "public procurement law", "public procurement laws", "public utilities", "queries", "regulatory framework", "regulatory regime", "regulatory systems", "result", "results", "supervision", "telephone", "telephone connection", "transition economies", "transparency", "users", "uses", "world trade"], "pubtype": ["World Bank Study"], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2265/594650PUB0ID1810Box358282B01PUBLIC1.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2265/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2265", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:02:43Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2262": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2262/594610PUB0ID1710Box358282B01PUBLIC1.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2262/594610PUB0ID1710Box358282B01PUBLIC1.txt?sequence=2", "title": "How to Engage with the Private Sector in Public-Private Partnerships in Emerging Markets", "abstract": "What transforms a desirable project on a government wish list to an attractive investment opportunity in the eyes of a potential private sector partner?

And, given commodity price volatility, growing human and environmental pressures, and worries about food security, this interest will increase, especially in the developing world. One of the highest development priorities in the world must be to improve smallholder agricultural productivity, especially in Africa. Smallholder productivity is essential for reducing poverty and hunger, and more and better investment in agricultural technology, infrastructure, and market access for poor farmers is urgently needed. When done right, larger-scale farming systems can also have a place as one of many tools to promote sustainable agricultural and rural development, and can directly support smallholder productivity, for example, throughout grower programs. However, recent press and other reports about actual or proposed large farmland acquisition by big investors have raised serious concerns about the danger of neglecting local rights and other problems. They have also raised questions about the extent to which such transactions can provide long-term benefits to local populations and contribute to poverty reduction and sustainable development. Although these reports are worrying, the lack of reliable information has made it difficult to understand what has been actually happening.

The data are representative of about 200 million children living in 19 countries over the last 15 years. Second, it compares human opportunity in LAC with that of developed countries, among them the United States and France, two very different models of social policy. This allows for illuminating exercises in benchmarking and extrapolation. Third, it looks at human opportunity within countries, across regions, states, and cities. This gives us a preliminary glimpse at the geographic dimension of equity, and at the role that different federal structures play. The overall message that emerges is one of cautious hope. LAC is making progress in opening the doors of development to all, but it still has a long way to go. At the current pace, it would take, on average, a generation for the region to achieve universal access to just the basic services that make for human opportunity. Seen from the viewpoint of equity, even our most successful nations lag far behind the developed world, and intracounty regional disparities are large and barely converging.

The liberalization of trade and investment in financial services is only a subset of the broader financial liberalization agenda. The purpose of trade and investment liberalization is to increase financial market access and remove discriminatory and other access-impeding barriers to foreign competition. By contrast, the main purpose of financial liberalization is to remove distortions in domestic financial systems that impede competition and the allocation of capital to its most productive and profitable uses. In turn, financial liberalization can be divided into domestic financial reform and capital account opening, and there is a rich literature on its appropriate speed and sequencing. The first part of the book covers the fundamental principles that affect trade liberalization in financial services at both the multilateral and the regional levels. It analyzes the various models of preferential trade agreements (PTAs) used by negotiators and the architectural differences of these models. The second part of this book provides concrete examples of how countries have negotiated these agreements by focusing on the specific country experiences of Chile, Colombia, and Costa Rica.

In the 21st century, agriculture remains fundamental to economic growth, poverty alleviation, and environmental sustainability. The World Bank's Agriculture and rural development publication series presents recent analyses of issues that affect the role of agriculture, including livestock, fisheries, and forestry, as a source of economic development, rural livelihoods, and environmental services. The series is intended for practical application, and hope that it will serve to inform public discussion, policy formulation, and development planning. Increased global demand for land because of higher and more volatile food prices, urbanization, and use of land for environmental services implies an increased need for well-designed land policies at the country level to ensure security of long-held rights, to facilitate land access, and to deal with externalities. Establishing the infrastructure necessary to proactively deal with these challenges can require large amounts of resources. Yet with land tenure deeply rooted in any country's history, a wide continuum of land rights, and vast differences in the level of socioeconomic development, the benefits to be expected and the challenges faced will vary across and even within countries, implying a need to adapt the nature and sequencing of reforms to country circumstances. Also, as reforms will take time to bear fruit and may be opposed by vested interests, there is a need to identify challenges and to reach consensus on how to address them in a way that allows objective monitoring of progress over time. Without this being done, the chances of making quick progress in addressing key land policy challenges are likely to be much reduced. The Land Governance Assessment Framework (LGAF) is intended as a first step to help countries deal with these issues. It is a diagnostic tool that is to be implemented at the local level in a collaborative fashion, that addresses the need for guidance to diagnose and benchmark land governance, and that can help countries prioritize reforms and monitor progress over time.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2376", "subjectTags": ["access to land", "accountability", "agricultural productivity", "agriculture", "allocation of land", "allocation of resources", "aquaculture", "audits", "autonomy", "betterment levies", "capacity building", "capital gains", "carbon", "carbon emissions", "cities", "climate", "climate change", "common property", "common property resources", "compensation", "corporate governance", "debt", "decentralization", "deforestation", "degradation of natural resources", "devolution", "ecological conditions", "economic development", "economic growth", "economics", "empirical basis", "entitlements", "environmental", "environmental impacts", "ethnic groups", "evasion", "externalities", "financial accountability", "financial intermediation", "financial management", "financial markets", "financial services", "financial systems", "financial transactions", "fiscal policy", "fisheries", "food policy research", "forest", "forestry", "forests", "fuel", "global interest", "housing", "income", "institutional arrangements", "institutional framework", "institutional reforms", "land administration", "land management", "land ownership", "land resources", "land rights", "land taxation", "land tenure", "land use", "land use planning", "laws", "legal framework", "legislation", "licenses", "local government", "local government accountability", "local governments", "local level", "mandates", "market prices", "migration", "municipal finance", "municipalities", "natural resource", "natural resources", "negative externalities", "partnership", "pastoralists", "pasture", "pastures", "penalties", "policy decisions", "policy environment", "policy makers", "political economy", "political power", "population growth", "poverty reduction", "private sector", "productivity", "property rights", "property tax revenue", "property transfers", "property values", "public", "public administration", "public economics", "public expenditure", "public good", "public goods", "public institutions", "public investment", "public investment in infrastructure", "public land", "public lands", "public officials", "public policy", "public provision", "public sector", "public services", "public spending", "public utilities", "resource allocation", "resource management", "resource use", "revenue mobilization", "revenue sources", "roads", "rural development", "rural livelihoods", "settlements", "slums", "state lands", "state ownership", "streams", "subsidiary", "sustainable development", "sustainable management", "sustainable use", "tax", "tax revenue", "tax revenues", "taxation", "timber", "transaction costs", "transparency", "transport", "unemployment", "urban areas", "urban land management", "urban planning", "urbanization", "waters"], "pubtype": ["Agriculture and Rural Development"], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2376/657430PUB0EPI1065724B09780821387580.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2376/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2376", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:05:09Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2377": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2377/657450PUB0EPI1065724B09780821389805.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2377/657450PUB0EPI1065724B09780821389805.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Citizens and Service Delivery : Assessing the Use of Social Accountability Approaches in the Human Development Sectors", "abstract": "Efforts by governments, donors, and civil society alike to improve governance, accountability, and development results on the ground have heightened attention to the idea that citizens can contribute to better public services by holding their policy makers, providers, and program managers accountable. While the use of social accountability to improve services in low- and middle-income countries is not new, the topic has gained currency in recent years. This book looks at how this works in practice. It aims to learn from the experiences gained from the implementation of World Bank projects and from the small, but growing, set of impact evaluations. The review is a first step to identify lessons, knowledge gaps, and questions for further research that can improve the use of these tools in government policies and through programs supported by civil society and donors, including the World Bank. The book documents a diverse and exciting set of cases the rapid adoption of access-to-information laws, the use of public expenditure tracking surveys by civil society organizations to 'follow the money' from central government budgets to schools and health clinics, and the incorporation of grievance redress mechanisms into the design of conditional cash transfer programs. Many of the examples discussed here are new initiatives, and some are being evaluated now.

With the financial support provided by the Bank, borrowers implement projects and programs, including the procurement of goods, works, and services necessary to carry out the project or program activities. The study begins by outlining the principal features of the Bank Group's sanctions process as it exists today (part two) and sketches some the key consideration underlying reform of the Bank's sanctions process (part three). It then describes how those considerations have influenced the historical evolution of the sanctions process (part four), with particular focus on the recent changes that the Bank has adopted to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and procedural of that process (part five). Finally, it concludes by reflecting on some of the longer-term implications of the reform process to date (part six).", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2373", "subjectTags": ["abuse", "accountability", "adjudication", "administrative law", "affiliate", "affiliated companies", "affiliates", "anti-corruption", "anticorruption", "auditing", "auditors", "audits", "banks", "best practice", "best practices", "civil law", "civil penalties", "collusion", "collusive practice", "conflict of interest", "constitutional law", "corrupt", "corrupt practice", "corrupt practices", "corruption", "court", "courts", "criminal", "criminal law", "criminal procedure", "customary practice", "declaration", "discretion", "dismissal", "due process", "ethics", "financial institutions", "financial intermediaries", "forgery", "fraud", "fraudulent practice", "freedom of information", "freedom of information laws", "global governance", "good governance", "human rights", "integrity", "internal controls", "international law", "investigation", "investigations", "investigators", "judicial process", "judicial processes", "justice", "laws", "lawyers", "legal framework", "legal status", "legal theories", "legislation", "liability", "liberty", "malfeasance", "mdb", "multilateral development banks", "multinational", "national law", "negotiation", "negotiations", "offense", "potential exposure", "predictability", "privacy", "procurement", "prosecution", "prosecutor", "prosecutors", "public funds", "remedies", "remedy", "rule of law", "sanction", "sanctions", "subsidiaries", "subsidiary", "transparency", "will", "zero tolerance"], "pubtype": ["World Bank Study"], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2373/651770REPLACEM0ctions09780821389690.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2373/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2373", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:05:05Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2378": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2378/644400REPLACEM0t0201109780821388280.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2378/644400REPLACEM0t0201109780821388280.txt?sequence=2", "title": "The World Bank Annual Report 2011", "abstract": "Executive Directors continued to play an important role as the World Bank faced many challenges in a global post crisis economy.

book builds on previous research, including that by the World Bank, on trade in services. Such research includes analyses of the effect of liberalizing services in developing countries and sectoral studies on financial, transportation, telecommunication, and professional services, as well as on international negotiations. The conceptual framework for this book is based on the existing literature on the service sector (Francois and Hoekman 2010; Hoekman and Mattoo 2008). Recognizing the heterogeneity in both, economic structure of developing countries and their service exports, this book takes an eclectic approach to identifying successful strategies. Chapter two surveys the literature on determinants of service exports and presents an illustrative empirical model that synthesizes the available models on trade in services. Because trade data on services are scarce and have a number of weaknesses, rigorous econometric analysis has serious limits. The subsequent chapters of the book examine the determinants of trade in services through case studies of the experiences of countries with varying degrees of success. The book analyzes service export performance for the following countries: Brazil, Chile, the Arab Republic of Egypt, India, Kenya, Malaysia, and the Philippines. The countries were selected on the basis of their performance in global trade (especially trade in services), their regional role, and the availability of data and because they have consciously pursued policies to promote service exports.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2379", "subjectTags": ["trade"], "pubtype": [], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2379/658370EPI188160Box365736B0Exporting.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2379/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2379", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:05:12Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2415": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2415/530980PUB0glob101Official0Use0only1.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2415/530980PUB0glob101Official0Use0only1.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Global Economic Prospects 2010 : Crisis, Finance, and Growth", "abstract": "The world economy is emerging from the throes of a historically deep and synchronized recession provoked by the bursting of a global financial bubble. The consequences of the initial bubble and the crisis have been felt in virtually every economy, whether or not it participated directly in the risky behaviors that precipitated the boom-and-bust cycle. And while growth rates have picked up, the depth of the recession means that it will take years before unemployment and spare capacity are reabsorbed. This year's global economic prospects examines the consequences of the crisis for both the short and medium term growth prospects of developing countries. It concludes that the crisis and the regulatory reaction to the financial excesses of the preceding several years may have lasting impacts on financial markets, raising borrowing costs and lowering levels of credit and international capital flows. As a result, the rate of growth of potential output in developing countries may be reduced by between 0.2 and 0.7 percentage points annually over the next five to seven years as economies adjust to tighter financial conditions. Overall, the level of potential output in developing countries could be reduced by between 3.4 and 8 percent over the long run, compared with its pre-crisis path. The report further finds that the very liquid conditions of the first half of the decade contributed to the expansion in credit available in developing countries and that this expansion was responsible for about 40 percent of the approximately 1.5 percentage point acceleration of the pace at which many developing-country economies could grow without generating significant inflation. While developing countries probably cannot reverse the expected tightening in international financial conditions, there is considerable scope for reducing domestic borrowing costs, or increasing productivity and thereby regaining the higher growth path that the crisis has derailed.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2415", "subjectTags": ["access to capital", "asset price", "balance

"For decades, the earnings from farming in many developing countries have been depressed because of a pro-urban, anti-agricultural bias in own-country policies and because governments in more well off countries are favoring their farmers by imposing import barriers and providing subsidies. These policies have reduced national and global economic welfare, inhibited economic growth, and added to inequality and poverty because no less than three-quarters of the billion poorest people in the world have been dependent directly or indirectly on farming for their livelihoods (World Bank 2007). The purpose of the rest of this chapter is to outline the analytical framework and the common empirical methodology adopted in the global and national case studies reported in subsequent chapters, to summarize and compare the modeling results from the global and national models, and to draw some general policy implications. The findings are based on three chapters (part two) that each use a global model to examine the effects of farm and nonfarm price and trade policies on global poverty and the distribution of poverty within and across many of the countries identified, plus ten individual developing-country studies (parts three-five) spanning the three key regions: Asia (where nearly two-thirds of the world's poor live), Sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2430", "subjectTags": ["agriculture", "agricultural price distortions", "inequality", "poverty"], "pubtype": [], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2430/538790PUB0agri101Official0use0Only1.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2430/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2430", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:33:24Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2279": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2279/581080PUB0REPL10Box353788B01PUBLIC1.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2279/581080PUB0REPL10Box353788B01PUBLIC1.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Growth and Productivity in Agriculture and Agribusiness : Evaluative Lessons from World Bank Group Experience", "abstract": "The World Bank Group has a unique opportunity to match the increases in financing for agriculture with a sharper focus on improving agricultural growth and productivity in agriculture-based economies, notably in Sub-Saharan Africa. Greater effort will be needed to connect sectoral interventions and achieve synergies from public and private sector interventions; to build capacity and knowledge exchange; to take stock of experience in rain-fed agriculture; to ensure attention to financial sustainability and to cross-cutting issues of gender, environmental, and social impacts and climate; and to better integrate the World Bank Group support at the global and regional levels with that at the country level. This evaluation uses the typology of economies developed by the Agriculture for Development: World Development Report 2008 as one classification in its analysis. In the agriculture-based category, which includes most of Sub-Saharan Africa, development of the agriculture sector is essential to growth and poverty reduction, yet productivity is low, constrained by limited access to modern inputs, irrigation, communication, and transport.

This is done through a case study in the Peruvian Andes. There are few examples of predictions of the impact of climate change on resource availability and even fewer examples of the applications of such predictions to planning for sustainable economic development. This report presents a summary of the efforts of a Bank energy and climate change team to develop methodological tools for the assessment of climate impacts on surface hydrology in the Peruvian Andes. The importance of analyzing the potential climate impacts on hydrology in Peru arises in part from concerns about the retreat of tropical glaciers, the drying of unique Andean wetland ecosystems, as well as increased weather variability and weather extremes, all of which will affect water regulation. The study, together with a recently published report by the World Bank, Peru Overcoming the Barriers to Hydropower, is intended to inform plans for energy development in Peru and enable provides some insights into how hydrology may behave under future climate scenarios in Peru, the main purpose is to contribute to the methodological approaches to anticipate impacts from climate change in the Andes

The main findings were synthesized in a flagship report titled Africa's Infrastructure: A Time for Transformation, published in November 2009. Meant for policy makers, that report necessarily focused on the high-level conclusions. It attracted widespread media coverage feeding directly into discussions at the 2009 African Union Commission Heads of State Summit on Infrastructure. Although the flagship report served a valuable role in highlighting the main findings of the project, it could not do full justice to the richness of the data collected and technical analysis undertaken. There was clearly a need to make this more detailed material available to a wider audience of infrastructure practitioners. Hence the idea of producing four technical monographs, such as this one, to provide detailed results on each of the major infrastructure sectors, information and communication technologies (ICT), power, transport, and water, as companions to the flagship report. These technical volumes are intended as reference books on each of the infrastructure sectors. They cover all aspects of the AICD project relevant to each sector, including sector performance, gaps in financing and efficiency, and estimates of the need for additional spending on investment, operations, and maintenance. Each volume also comes with a detailed data appendix, providing easy access to all the relevant infrastructure indicators at the country level, which is a resource in and of itself.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2275", "subjectTags": [], "pubtype": ["Directions in Development ; infrastructure"], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2275/608030PUB0Afri10Box358332B01PUBLIC1.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2275/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2275", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:03:02Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2274": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2274/600610PUB0REPL10Box358308B01PUBLIC1.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2274/600610PUB0REPL10Box358308B01PUBLIC1.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Public-Private Partnerships in Europe and Central Asia : Designing Crisis-Resilient Strategies and Bankable Projects", "abstract": "This study aims to help governments design sustainable Public-Private Partnership (PPP) strategies and projects in the context of the changed circumstances brought on by the global financial and economic crisis that began in the fall of 2008. The study analyses the impact and implication of the crisis on PPP infrastructure projects across the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) region. In the research undertaken for this study, it appears that most crisis-specific issues are cross-sectoral, therefore requiring cross-sectoral responses. The intended audience for this report includes national government stakeholders involved in infrastructure financing, including Ministries in charge of infrastructure, especially transport, energy, and water; state-owned enterprises with operational responsibilities, such as road directorates; and Ministries of Finance and development banks involved in PPP. This report reviewed the region's experience in PPPs in infrastructure before and during the financial crisis period (from late 2006 to 2010). Since not all ECA countries have had successful or ongoing PPP projects during this time, the report draws on lessons from Brazil, India, Spain, and the United Kingdom, countries with established PPP project pipelines to draw on cross-sectoral lessons. The findings can be used by countries wishing to start or re-start their PPP program following the impact of the recent crisis. However, beyond the crisis and its effects, the report can also guide future development of sustainable and crisis-resilient PPP programs. Most of the analysis supporting the report recommendations was undertaken for the highway sector and was financed through from a grant from the transport research support program. Initially, the highway sector was the focus of this study but the scope was later widened to include all infrastructure sectors because most issues facing highway PPP projects are common to other sectors requiring a cross-sectoral approach to PPP. Sector-specific strategies for highways have been documented in a recent World Bank study.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2274", "subjectTags": ["accountability", "accounting", "adb",

In response, the World Bank Group increased lending to unprecedented levels. The World Bank posted a large increase in middle income countries (MICs), and a much smaller one in low income countries (LICs). The International Finance Corporation (IFC) focused on trade finance, mainly in LICs. Its new business initially fell in MICs, rebounding only in late fiscal 2010. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) concentrated on guarantees in Eastern Europe. Analytic and advisory work helped inform government and private sector responses to the crisis. This report presents an initial real-time evaluation of the readiness, relevance, quality-at-entry, short-term results, and likely sustainability of the Bank Group response from the start of the crisis through fiscal 2010. This evaluation builds on a 2008 Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) assessment of Bank Group interventions during past crises and draws extensively on 11 country case studies and field visits.

and Alternatives", "abstract": "The Africa Infrastructure Country Diagnostic (AICD) has produced continent-wide analysis of many aspects of Africa's infrastructure challenge. The main findings were synthesized in a flagship report titled Africa's Infrastructure: a time for transformation, published in November 2009. Meant for policy makers, that report necessarily focused on the high-level conclusions. It attracted widespread media coverage feeding directly into discussions at the 2009 African Union Commission Heads of State Summit on Infrastructure. Although the flagship report served a valuable role in highlighting the main findings of the project, it could not do full justice to the richness of the data collected and technical analysis undertaken. There was clearly a need to make this more detailed material available to a wider audience of infrastructure practitioners. Hence the idea of producing four technical monographs, such as this one, to provide detailed results on each of the major infrastructure sectors, information and communication technologies (ICT), power, transport, and water, as companions to the flagship report. These technical volumes are intended as reference books on each of the infrastructure sectors. They cover all aspects of the AICD project relevant to each sector, including sector performance, gaps in financing and efficiency, and estimates of the need for additional spending on investment, operations, and maintenance. Each volume also comes with a detailed data appendix, providing easy access to all the relevant infrastructure indicators at the country level, which is a resource in and of itself.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2276", "subjectTags": ["access to safe drinking water", "access to safe water", "access to sanitation", "access to water", "access to water supply", "adequate sanitation", "administrative capacity", "affordability of water", "availability of water", "block tariff", "block tariff structure", "block tariffs", "boreholes", "broad range", "bulk water", "central government", "concession contract", "connection cost", "construction", "cost recovery", "covering", "cubic meter", "cubic meters", "demand management", "distribution networks", "distribution system", "domestic tariffs", "drinking water", "drinking water coverage", "flush toilet", "flush toilets", "global water supply", "hand pumps", "house connection", "household connection", "household connections", "households", "irrigation", "large cities", "low water", "metering", "minerals", "national water", "national water company", "natural resources", "nonrevenue water", "open defecation", "operational efficiency", "operational performance", "operators", "performance contract", "performance contracts", "performance data", "performance indicators", "physical infrastructure", "piped water", "pit latrine", "pit latrines", "pits", "population density", "population growth", "pressure", "private participation", "provision of water", "public health", "public standposts", "public tap", "quality of service", "quality of water", "quality of water supply", "rainwater", "regulatory agencies", "regulatory agency", "regulatory framework", "regulatory frameworks", "residential consumers", "rural water", "rural water supply", "safe sanitation", "sanitation access", "sanitation assessment", "sanitation authority", "sanitation coverage", "sanitation facilities", "sanitation infrastructure", "sanitation market", "sanitation options", "sanitation program", "sanitation sector", "sanitation services", "sanitation tariffs", "sanitation tax", "sanitation utilities", "sanitation water", "septic tank", "septic tanks", "service continuity", "service delivery", "service provider", "service providers", "service provision", "service quality", "sewage disposal", "sewerage", "sewerage authority", "sewerage company", "sewerage network", "sewerage systems", "sources of water", "stakeholder involvement", "supply water", "surface sources", "surface water", "tariff adjustment", "tariff structure", "toilet facilities", "urban areas", "urban households", "urban residents", "urban utilities", "urban water", "urban water sector", "urban water supply", "urban water utilities", "urbanization", "user charges", "users", "utilities corporation", "utility efficiency", "vip latrines", "wastewater", "wastewater management", "water availability", "water bills", "water board", "water company", "water connection", "water connections", "water consumption", "water coverage", "water distribution", "water infrastructure", "water losses", "water market", "water markets", "water points", "water production", "water quality", "water sanitation", "water scarcity", "water sector", "water service", "water service provision", "water services", "water source", "water sources", "water standposts", "water supply", "water table", "water tankers", "water tariffs", "water utilities", "water vendors", "wells"], "pubtype": ["Directions in Development ; infrastructure"], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2276/608040PUB0Afri10Box358332B01PUBLIC1.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2276/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2276", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:03:02Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2271": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2271/600510PUB0ID181mpacts09780821386972.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2271/600510PUB0ID181mpacts09780821386972.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Climate Impacts on Energy Systems : Key Issues for Energy Sector Adaptation", "abstract": "This report presents an overview of how the energy sector might be impacted by climate change and what options exist for its management. It focuses on energy sector adaptation, rather than mitigation, which has been a key focus of the energy sector and is not discussed in this report. This report draws on available scientific and peer-reviewed literature in the public domain and takes the perspective of the developing world to the extent possible. It starts with a discussion about observed and projected climate change (out to 2100), exploring trends, extremes, and 'hotspots'- geographic regions that will see significant changes or variability for relevant parameters (for example, temperature, runoff , and sea level rise). It then discusses what is known about the impacts of these changes on energy resources, infrastructure, and transportation systems as well as demand. It discusses what technologies or services are more vulnerable and identifies gaps in information or knowledge. The report concludes with a number of proposed near-term actions to foster dialogue, to further inform sector practitioners, to disaggregate climate impacts to regional and local settings, and to improve the knowledge base. Underpinning all actions is recognition of the need for a broad and participatory approach that extends beyond traditional planning horizons and boundaries.", "uri":

It provides a measured and insightful review and assessment of the results of a variety of approaches that developing countries are experimenting with in their quest for better schools. It is not the final word on the subject, but will hopefully contribute to better policy choices, grounded in the evidence currently available. This book is about the threats to education quality that cannot be explained by lack of resources. It focuses on publicly financed school systems and the phenomenon of service delivery failures: cases where programs and policies that increase the inputs to education fail to produce effective delivery of services where it counts-in schools and classrooms. It documents what authors know about the extent and costs of service delivery failures in public education in the developing world. And it further develops aspects of the conceptual model posited in the World development report 2004: that a root cause of low-quality and inequitable public services-not only in education-is the weak 'accountability' of providers to both their supervisors and their clients (World Bank 2003). The central focus of this book, however, is a new story. It is that developing countries are increasingly adopting innovative strategies to attack these issues.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2270", "subjectTags": ["academic achievement", "access to

Five studies have been commissioned to examine the state of annuity markets in each of these countries. The findings of these studies are summarized in the last five chapters of this book. The chapters of this book is discusses the various risks faced by pensioners and the risk characteristics of alternative retirement products, and it reviews the risks faced by providers of retirement products and the management and regulatory challenges of dealing with those risks. The chapter then discusses the risks faced by providers and reviews the challenges of various regulatory issues, ranging from the institutional organization of the market for retirement products to the regulation of marketing and pricing policies and the regulation of risk management.

It includes not only those who are directly involved with technology, industry, science, and education but also those in charge of finance and economics, and indeed the top government leadership, which plays a crucial role in successful innovation policies. This overview follows the organization of the volume, which is divided into parts and chapters.

This reform approach is characterized by a move toward multi-pillar pension systems and includes the creation or extension of a mandatory funded pillar with defined contribution design. The rationale and viability of such a pillar is contingent on an enabling environment and the delivery of high risk-adjusted net rates of return that beat the natural benchmark, which is the internal rate of return that an unfunded mandated scheme is able to achieve. Two key aspects of mandated and funded defined contribution schemes have been under discussion and investigation since dedicated pension funds were created: (a) the high fees levied by privately organized pension funds and the consequence for the net rate of return; and (b) the investment products of these funds and their capability to address the investment risks and to deliver the expected retirement income in a life-cycle context. To this end, country policies have experimented with a variety of approaches to improve outcomes with some important leads but overall modest results. This book proposes to take a fresh and highly innovative look at both policy issues. It suggests stepping back and looking at the underlying causes of the issues at stake instead of merely trying to address their symptoms. In addressing the high fees of pension funds, it focuses on the less-than-ideal conditions inert consumers facing firms with market powers and proposes to apply solutions derived from industrial organization models and pricing methods that better reflect the cost structure of the supply of pension services. In addressing the investment risks, it asks how to improve fund managers' risk-adjusted investment performance when participants are inert.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2462", "subjectTags":

the employment intensity of growth. The report consists of six chapters. Chapter one provides an overview of the book's main findings, reviews Nigeria's growth performance from 2001 to 2007, and addresses the question of the sustainability of that growth performance. Chapter two analyzes the evolution of the labor market since 1999. The analysis focuses on the share of the formal and informal sectors in employment, the trend in incomes in the formal and the informal sectors, and the unemployment rate. Chapter three addresses the question of what Nigeria can do to increase the availability of quality jobs and reduce rising youth unemployment. Chapter four discusses Nigeria's industrial policy and investment environment. Chapter five proposes strategies for skills development; and chapter six analyzes the effects of restrictive trade policies.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2463", "subjectTags": ["economic growth", "aged", "agricultural output", "agricultural production", "appropriate technology", "average annual growth", "capital formation", "capital goods", "capitals", "central planning", "chemical fertilizers", "cities", "coal", "decentralization", "economic conditions", "economic development", "economic growth", "economic institutions", "economic welfare", "economists", "employment", "families", "farms", "forestry", "girls", "growth process", "growth rate", "health care", "holidays", "imports", "income", "industrial expansion", "iron", "labor force", "labor inputs", "labor productivity", "leisure", "media", "migration", "modern economic growth", "new entrants", "oil", "power plants", "productivity", "schools", "share of output", "total labor force", "total output", "transport", "unemployment", "workers", "employment policy", "manpower", "participation rate", "agricultural workers", "industrial workers", "rural employment", "labor intensity"], "pubtype": ["Directions in Development ; countries and regions"], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2463/550230PUB0Nige10Box349432B01PUBLIC1.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2463/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2463", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:34:14Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2404": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2404/527080PUB0lead101Official0Use0Only1.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2404/527080PUB0lead101Official0Use0Only1.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Leadership and Growth : Commission on Growth and Development", "abstract": "In May 2008, the commission on growth and development (the growth commission) issued its report entitled 'the growth report'. In it the commission attempted to distill what had been learned in the past two decades, from experience and academic and policy research, about strategies and policies that produced sustained high growth in developing countries. It became clear in the course of the work that politics, leadership, and political economy (the interaction of economic and political forces and choices) were centrally important ingredients in the story. Dealing with the politics and the interaction of political and economic forces is a work in progress in research, an important one. Given this breadth, one of the editors' roles is to focus the reader's attention on what they take to be common issues across these chapters. These common problems are fourfold: (1) promoting national unity; (2) building good, solid institutions; (3) choosing innovative and localized policies; and (4) creating political consensus for long-run policy implementation. This report represent an excellent first step toward understanding the role of leadership in generating economic growth, and the author hope that they generate ideas and lead to new research on the

Controlling Flows of Illicit Funds from Developing Countries", "abstract": "The book provides the first collection of analytic contributions, as opposed to advocacy essays and black box estimates, on illicit financial flows (IFFs). Some of the chapter presents new empirical findings; others, new conceptual insights. All of them enrich the understanding of the dynamics of the illicit flows phenomenon. The book does not offer a new estimate of the global total of these flows because the phenomenon is too poorly understood. The chapters are based on papers first presented at a September 2009 conference at the World Bank. Each paper had one or two assigned discussants, and the revisions reflect the often searching critiques of the discussants, as well as additional comments from the editor and from two external peer reviewers.

Post-crisis conditions are very different from those of preceding years. Financial resources are more limited and more expensive, and export growth is restrained by potentially slower growth in destination countries. Restoring and sustaining growth in this context require reforms that boost competitiveness and increase labor productivity. Such reforms are all the more important given the shrinking of the working-age population in many countries of the region. This book uses a range of different data sources to argue that the skills problem in the ECA region relates more to the quality and relevance of the education provided in ECA countries than to problems of access. A central argument of the book is that ministries of education are constrained in a number of ways from effectively managing their education and training sectors. The three most important and interrelated impediments to improving quality and relevance are the lack of systematic data on key skills-related performance issues (i.e., how much students are learning and whether they are finding jobs after they graduate), the legacy of central planning, and inefficient use of resources. Lack of data on student learning and employment outcomes makes it difficult for education ministries to address the legacy of central planning, which emphasizes centralized management based on inputs. Ministries of education in the region continue to micromanage the sector using detailed norms and regulations. This input-oriented style of management leads to the inefficient use of resources and results in a rigid education sector not the type of flexible sector needed by ECA to create modern, skilled workforces. This book highlights how these constraints manifest themselves and then presents ways of overcoming them, relying on the experience of ECA countries that have successfully addressed them, together with international experience. Recommendations are presented in separate chapters for pre-university, tertiary, and adult education.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2368", "subjectTags": ["academic performance", "accreditation", "adult education", "adult learning", "adult training", "adults", "assessment instruments", "average class size", "background papers", "basic education", "basic reading", "basic skills", "block grants", "class size", "class sizes", "classroom", "classrooms", "cognitive skills", "cognitive tasks", "conditions of teachers", "course offerings", "credit transfer", "curriculum", "decentralization", "decision making", "diplomas", "early grades", "education authorities", "education facilities", "education for life", "education level", "education managers", "education ministries", "education policy", "education providers", "education reforms", "education sector", "education system", "education systems", "educational achievements", "educational attainment", "educational institutions", "educational outcomes", "educational quality", "employment", "employment outcomes", "enrollment rates", "exam", "exams", "fields of study", "formal education", "formal training", "general secondary education", "global knowledge", "gross enrollment", "gross enrollment rates", "higher education", "higher education development", "higher education institutions", "higher learning", "highly skilled labor", "human development", "human resource development", "individual learning", "institutional autonomy", "international education", "international literacy", "international organization for standardization", "job market", "job opportunities", "knowledge economy", "labor force", "labor market needs", "labour market", "leadership", "learning", "learning assessments", "learning environment", "learning outcomes", "level of education", "levels of education", "lifelong learning", "literacy", "literacy skills", "lower secondary education", "lower secondary level", "mathematics", "ministries of education", "ministry of education", "mobility", "national assessment", "national assessments", "national qualifications framework", "number of schools", "number of students", "number of teachers", "numeracy", "organizational change", "parity", "participation rates", "primary education", "primary level", "primary school", "primary school classes", "problem solving", "problem-solving skills", "professional development", "public expenditure", "public school", "quality assurance", "quality assurance agencies", "quality education", "quality of education", "reading", "reading level", "remedial education", "responsive education systems", "retraining", "returns to education", "school classes", "school councils", "school decision", "school development", "school operations", "school principals", "school system", "school systems", "schooling", "schools", "science study", "secondary education", "secondary school", "secondary schools", "secondary students", "skill levels", "skilled occupations", "skilled workers", "standardized tests", "student assessment", "student assessments", "student choice", "student costs", "student learning", "student learning outcomes", "student-teacher ratio", "student-teacher ratios", "teacher", "teacher ratios", "teachers", "teaching", "teaching force", "technical colleges", "technical education", "technical skills", "tertiary education", "tertiary education sector", "tertiary education systems", "tertiary enrollments", "tertiary institutions", "tertiary level", "tertiary sector", "test scores", "traditional universities", "training programs", "training services", "tuition", "tuition fees", "unemployment rate", "unemployment rates", "universities", "university autonomy", "university education", "university graduates", "university level", "vocational education", "vocational school", "vocational schools", "vocational skills", "vocational training", "workers"], "pubtype": [], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2368/652050REPLACEM061562B09780821380963.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2368/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2368", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:04:59Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2244": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2244/668160PUB0EPI0067848B09780821394809.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2244/668160PUB0EPI0067848B09780821394809.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Developing Public-Private Partnerships in Liberia", "abstract": "The Government of Liberia is in the process of developing a new Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) that is intended to determine its path toward middle-income status. One central aspect of the strategy is likely to be a stronger focus on inclusive growth. This will mean that higher priority will be placed on growing the local private sector, and broadening the base of the economy. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) in infrastructure and services can be a key instrument for achieving these goals especially in an economy like Liberia. The analysis contained in this study identifies the steps toward establishing PPPs as both a policy instrument and method for deepening private sector investment in Liberia. Liberia's rich natural resource endowments have played a fundamental role in the way in which the economy has developed, and in the way in which Government manages private investment in extractive industries. The Government itself has a long history of entering into concession contracts with private investors and operators. Firestone rubber first signed a concession agreement in 1926, and re-signed their concession to last until 2041. More recently, the Government of Liberia has entered into several large natural resource and mining concession contracts that will see large sums of private sector capital invested onshore. This study is one element of a multi-faceted effort to support local private sector and financial sector development in Liberia. It takes into close account the Government's focus on job-creation, the post-conflict dynamics in the country, and Liberia's reliance on extractive industries as a primary source of revenue. The analysis also builds on previous economic sector work that has looked closely at how to stimulate private sector growth and investment, how to support small and medium-size enterprise (SME), and how to leverage existing private sector investment to generate deeper local markets and create new jobs.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2244", "subjectTags": ["airports", "best practices",

Investment and Create Jobs", "abstract": "The World Bank's strategy for Africa's future recognizes the central importance of industrialization in Sub-Saharan Africa, and the consequent creation of productive jobs for Africans, which have long been a preoccupation of African leaders and policy makers. This book represents an attempt to address these issues. The book stresses that, while the recent turnaround in Africa's economic growth is encouraging, this growth must be accompanied by structural transformation to be sustainable and to create productive employment for its people. For many African countries, this transformation involves lifting workers from low-productivity agriculture and informal sectors into higher productivity activities. Light manufacturing can offer a viable solution for Sub-Saharan Africa, given its potential competitiveness that is based on low wage costs and abundance of natural resources that supply raw materials needed for industries. This study has five features that distinguish it from previous studies. First, the detailed studies on light manufacturing at the subsector and product levels in five countries provide in-depth cost comparisons between Asia and Africa. Second, building on a growing body of work, the report uses a wide array of quantitative and qualitative techniques, including quantitative surveys and value chain analysis, to identify key constraints to enterprises and to evaluate differences in firm performance across countries. Third, the findings that firm constraints vary by country, sector, and firm size led us to adopt a targeted approach to identifying constraints and combining market-based measures and selected government interventions to remove them. Fourth, the solution to light manufacturing problems cuts across many sectors and does not lie only in manufacturing alone. Solving the problem of manufacturing inputs requires solving specific issues in agriculture, education, and infrastructure. Fifth, the report draws on experiences and solutions from other developing countries to inform its recommendations. The report's goal is to find practical ways to increase employment and spur job creation in Sub-Saharan Africa.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2245", "subjectTags": ["accountability", "agriculture", "analytical approach", "arable land", "automobiles", "bank loans", "banks", "bargaining", "bargaining power", "benchmark", "benchmarking", "benchmarks", "benefit analysis", "borrowing", "business environment", "business environments", "business regulations", "business strategy", "capital requirements", "carbon", "certificate", "chamber of commerce", "climatic conditions", "commodities", "commodity", "comparative advantage", "competitiveness", "connectivity", "copyright", "cost of living", "country comparisons", "customs", "debt", "demonstration effects", "deposits", "development economics", "e-mail", "economic activity", "economic conditions", "economic development", "economic growth", "economic performance", "economic structure", "economies of scale", "employment opportunities", "enterprise survey", "enterprise surveys", "entrepreneurial skills", "environments", "equipment", "exploitation", "export growth", "export market", "export markets", "export opportunities", "exports", "financial institutions", "financial support", "fiscal policies", "fishing", "fixed prices", "foreign direct investment", "foreign exchange", "foreign investments", "future studies", "gdp", "gdp per capita", "global economy", "global market", "global markets", "government intervention", "government policy", "gross domestic product", "housing", "human resource", "import tariffs", "income", "industrial base", "industrial development", "industrial economy", "industrial structure", "industrialization", "inexperienced workers", "inflation", "information technology", "innovation", "input prices", "inspection", "institution", "insurance", "job creation", "labor costs", "labor disputes", "labor efficiency", "labor force", "labor legislation", "labor productivity", "labor relations", "land prices", "land use", "laws", "legislation", "licenses", "limited access", "local government", "local governments", "logging", "macroeconomic stability", "managerial skills", "manufacturing", "manufacturing industries", "market information", "market liberalization", "market share", "marketing", "material", "medium enterprises", "metals", "migration", "monopolies", "natural resources", "new entrants", "occupations", "oil", "one-stop shops", "open economies", "outputs", "payouts", "pdf", "penalties", "pension plans", "per capita income", "photo", "physical infrastructure", "policy makers", "political economy", "price controls", "private investment", "private partnerships", "private sector", "private sector development", "private sector investments", "producers", "production costs", "productivity", "productivity growth", "proven reserves", "purchasing power", "quality management", "queries", "rent seeking", "result", "results", "retail trade", "safety", "safety net", "safety nets", "savings", "search", "skilled labor", "skilled workers", "social development", "structural change", "subsidiary", "supervision", "suppliers", "supply chain", "sustainable growth", "tax revenue", "tax revenues", "technical assistance", "technical skills", "technical support", "technical training", "telecommunications", "telephone", "timber", "time frame", "trade liberalization", "training costs", "transaction", "transaction costs", "transport", "unemployment", "unskilled workers", "uses", "value added", "value chain", "value chains", "wage rates", "wages", "wan", "web", "willingness to pay"], "pubtype": ["Africa Development Forum"], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2245/9782744076626.pdf.jpg?sequence=13", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2245/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2245", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T08:44:25Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2246": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2246/672080PUB0EPI0020Box367844B09953137.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2246/672080PUB0EPI0020Box367844B09953137.txt?sequence=2", "title": "The Cash Dividend : The Rise of Cash Transfer Programs in Sub-Saharan Africa", "abstract": "The results of the review do not disappoint. The authors identified more than 120 cash transfer programs that were implemented between 2000 and mid-2009 in Sub-Saharan Africa. These programs have varying objectives, targeting, scale, conditions, technologies, and more. A sizable number of these programs conducted robust impact evaluations that provide important information, presented here, on the merits of cash transfer programs and their specific design features in the African context. The authors present summary information on programs, often in useful graphs, and provide detailed reference material in the appendixes. They highlight how many of the cash transfer programs in Africa that had not yet begun implementation at the time of writing will continue to provide important evaluation results that will guide the design of cash transfer programs in the region. In addition to presenting data and analysis on the mechanics of the programs, the authors discuss issues related to political economy. They highlight the importance of addressing key tradeoffs in cash transfers, political will, and buy-in, and they emphasize the need to build evidence-based debates on cash transfer programs. Useful anecdotes and discussion illustrate how some programs have dealt with these issues with varying degrees of success. This text will serve as a useful reference for years to come for those interested in large- and small-scale issues of cash transfer implementation, both in Africa and beyond. However, the book is not an end in itself. It also raises important questions that must be addressed and knowledge gaps that must be filled.

Since the early 2000s, this drive has extended to developing countries, with most of them introducing anti-money laundering (AML) policies. The primary driver behind this is law enforcement; these policies are aimed at detecting and tracing flows of ill-gotten money, which would enable authorities to fight and prevent crime and recover assets of crime, corruption, and tax evasion. The core objective of this study is to introduce economics into the international debate about anti-money laundering, and to introduce the idea of the usefulness and effectiveness of such policies. The study focuses on two developing countries: Malawi, a low-income country, and Namibia, a middle-income country. The findings presented in this study are based on an extensive literature research; World Bank discussions with numerous public- and private-sector officials and representatives of the Governments of Malawi and Namibia during a Bank mission in November 2010; and workshops conducted in both countries in February 2011 to obtain feedback on the preliminary findings. In conducting this study, the team adopted an interactive approach. This was critical because mobilization of local expertise is essential not only in establishing a complete picture of current and future AML challenges, but also in designing policy considerations that subsequently are widely supported.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2362", "subjectTags": ["abuse", "access to finance", "access to financial services", "advanced economies", "agricultural

development indicators, which covers some 1,700 macroeconomic, sectoral, and human development indicators dating to the 1960s, comes at a critical time for Sub-Saharan Africa's 48 countries and 841 million people. After a decade of economic growth at nearly 5 percent a year, Africa-along with the rest of the world-was hit hard by the global economic crisis, but it rebounded within a year. In 2011 the continent's growth is expected to return to pre crisis levels. The poverty rate has been declining at about one percentage point a year, and progress on the millennium development goals, while insufficient to reach the 2015 targets in many countries, has been substantial. Yet, Africa faces some of the most formidable development challenges in the world. First, growth has been uneven, with about 20 fragile and conflict affected states seemingly trapped in persistent poverty. Second, economic growth has not translated to productive jobs and more earning opportunities for Africa's labor force-most of which is engaged in agriculture and informal enterprises-and especially for the 7-10 million young people entering the labor force each year. And third, Africa's growth could be faster and more widespread if it could address its most fundamental challenges-improving governance and increasing public sector capacity. A tool for learning, capacity strengthening, and accountability, Africa development indicators 2011 will continue to play a critical role in Africa's economic transformation.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2361", "subjectTags": ["agriculture", "annual exchange rate", "annual growth", "balance of payments", "capacity building", "capacity development", "cd", "child mortality", "citizens", "communication technology", "communications development", "consumer price index", "consumption expenditure", "copyright clearance", "copyright clearance center", "current account", "data availability", "debt", "debt relief", "deflators", "developing economies", "diseases", "dissemination", "domestic savings", "economic crisis", "economic growth", "economic situation", "economic statistics", "effective exchange rate", "environmental sustainability", "exchange rate", "exchange rate fluctuations", "exchange rates", "exports", "external trade", "extreme poverty", "financial sector", "financial sector infrastructure", "financial support", "fixed capital", "food prices", "foreign currencies", "gdp", "gdp deflator", "gdp per capita", "gender equality", "government finances", "gross domestic product", "gross domestic product deflator", "gross domestic product growth", "gross domestic product per capita", "gross fixed capital formation", "gross national income", "gross national savings", "growth rates", "human development", "imports", "income groups", "incomes", "inflation rate", "instrument", "international bank", "international inflation", "international standards", "international trade", "investment climate", "labor force", "legal status", "local currency", "malaria", "maternal health", "middle-income economies", "migration", "millennium development goal", "millennium development goals", "monetary fund", "national currency", "national income", "national incomes", "national strategy", "natural disasters", "oil exports", "persistent poverty", "political economy", "population census", "poverty reduction", "power parity", "price indexes", "private sector development", "progress", "public expenditure", "public policies", "purchasing power", "purchasing power parity", "rate of inflation", "regional integration", "relative exchange rates", "remittances", "return", "rural development", "sanitation", "social development", "tariff barriers", "total exports", "trade balance", "trade blocs", "transportation", "trust fund", "trust funds", "unemployment", "universal primary education", "value added", "weights", "young people"], "pubtype": [], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2361/649360PUB0Afri00Box361550B00Public0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2361/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2361", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:04:50Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2360": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2360/649370PUB0Fina00Box361550B00Public0.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2360/649370PUB0Fina00Box361550B00Public0.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Financial Access and Stability : A Road Map for the Middle East and North Africa", "abstract": "This report contributes to the effort to improve Middle East and North Africa's (MENA's) growth and employment performance by providing a diagnostic of MENA's financial systems and proposing a roadmap for more diversified, competitive, and inclusive financial systems. The report recognizes the need to complement the financial development agenda by a financial stability agenda, to ensure that financial systems remain resilient as access is expanded and new risks emerge. The report starts by briefly reviewing the main causes of MENA's unsatisfactory growth and employment performance, identifying the region's broader growth agenda and the role of financial development in this agenda. It proceeds by reviewing the size and structure of MENA's financial systems, showing that most of these systems are excessively bank based and undiversified. The chapter provides a battery of access indicators showing that access outcomes have been very poor relative to those in other regions. It discusses the main causes of these poor outcomes and proposes a comprehensive agenda for financial development and financial stability.

The law broadens the scope of the questions that people ask, and so helps policy makers find solutions to complex, multifaceted problems. To do that effectively, however, legal research and legal practitioners must focus on how the law can support innovative and pragmatic responses to development challenges. The law also has a role to play at the micro level of community-driven development.

From 1950 to 2005, for example, the region's real income per head rose sevenfold. With aging populations, these economies will need to derive an increasing share of growth from productivity improvements rather than from physical factor accumulation to drive growth. The book argues that higher education is failing to deliver skills for growth and research for innovation because of widespread disconnects between higher education institutions and other skill and research users and providers. These disconnects undermine the very functioning of the higher education system. The main assumption of the report is that to deliver labor market skills to higher education graduates, these institutions: (a) must have characteristics that are aligned with what employers and employees need; and (b) must be well connected among themselves and other skills providers. Similarly, to deliver research that can enhance innovation and productivity, higher education institutions need to have a strong role in research provision and have strong links with firms and other research providers.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2364", "subjectTags": ["academic degrees", "academic programs", "academic qualifications", "academic skills", "access to higher education", "adult literacy", "applied research", "background papers", "benefits to society", "block grants", "call", "career", "cognitive skills", "college education", "colleges", "competitive global economy", "completion rate", "completion rates", "creative thinking", "curriculum", "curriculum development", "curriculum reform", "diplomas", "disciplines", "distance learning", "doctoral degrees", "educated workers", "educated workforce", "education departments", "education expenditure", "education level", "education ministers", "educational achievement", "educational attainment", "educational institutions", "employment", "enrollment rates", "enrollment ratio", "enrollment ratios", "ethnic minorities", "faculty members", "formal education", "functional skills", "generic skills", "ger", "global environment", "global knowledge", "global market", "gross enrollment", "gross enrollment rates", "gross enrollment ratio", "gross enrollment ratios", "high school", "high school graduates", "higher education", "higher education access", "higher education contribution scheme", "higher education enrollment", "higher education institution", "higher education institutions", "higher education management", "higher education markets", "higher education outcomes", "higher education research", "higher education system", "higher education systems", "higher productivity", "human capital", "human development", "income-contingent", "income-contingent loans", "information technology", "institutional autonomy", "intellectual property", "international higher education", "international organization for standardization", "labor force", "labor market needs", "leadership", "learning", "learning technologies", "level of education", "liberal education", "life skills", "literacy", "literature", "local labor market", "low enrollment rates", "mathematics", "national qualifications framework", "national university", "numeracy", "parity", "primary education", "primary education systems", "private expenditure", "private higher education", "private higher education institutions", "private tertiary institutions", "problem solving", "professional degree", "professional education", "proficiency", "public expenditure", "public funds", "public higher education", "public institutions", "public tertiary education", "public university", "quality assurance", "quality of education", "quality of higher education", "quality of life", "quality of life for individuals", "reading", "reading achievement", "research capacity", "research functions", "research institutes", "research institutions", "research output", "research universities", "researchers", "return to education", "scholarships", "schooling", "schools", "science study", "secondary education", "secondary schools", "show how", "skill acquisition", "skill development", "skill levels", "skilled labor", "skilled workers", "social benefits", "socialization", "standardized tests", "student assessment", "student loan", "student loans", "subject areas", "teaching", "technical skills", "technological innovation", "technological innovations", "technology gap", "technology transfer", "tertiary education", "tertiary education systems", "tertiary enrollment", "tertiary enrollments", "tertiary graduates", "tertiary level", "tertiary school enrollment", "tertiary student enrollments", "tertiary students", "tuition", "tuition fees", "unemployment rates", "university degrees", "university departments", "university governance", "university graduates", "university management", "virtual universities", "vocational education", "vocational training", "young people"], "pubtype": ["World Bank East Asia and Pacific Regional Report"], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2364/649520REPLACEM01547B009780821384909.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2364/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2364", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:04:54Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2251": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2251/588460PUB0Redu101public10BOX353816B.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2251/588460PUB0Redu101public10BOX353816B.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Reducing Inequality for Shared Growth in China : Strategy and Policy Options for Guangdong Province", "abstract": "This overview summarizes the key findings of the eight chapters and one policy note.

This report presents insights from this research based on case studies of six sectors: agriculture, health, energy, information and communication technology (ICT), transport, and logistics. Based on more than 80 interviews cutting across Uganda's small and medium-sized enterprises, universities, and government entities, the report's findings are intended to offer the government and its partners in industry increased clarity about how better to harness science, technology, and innovation to propel the economy. Enabling implementation of the recent Uganda national science, technology, and innovation policy is a parallel goal of the report. The policy articulates the government's intent to foster research and development that builds the human capital that Uganda requires for a knowledge-based economy. The case studies from which this report's recommendations are drawn depict a diverse range of experiences across industrial sectors in terms of generating, applying, and adapting science and technology to contribute to Uganda's development. Despite the relatively small size of the country's investments in science and technology, the past 20 years have seen considerable advances in building capacity in science and technology, developing related institutions and human resources, advancing collaboration and communication, and expanding the base of available knowledge. But given Uganda's limited investments in science and technology, policies should prioritize near-term investments that benefit key sectors. This report identifies those near-term investments as well as longer-term ones (three to five years in the future).", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2250", "subjectTags": ["access to technology",

Asia", "abstract": "The Europe and Central Asia (ECA) region has been hit by a crisis on multiple fronts. Countries in ECA are facing major, interrelated, external macro-financial shocks. The first is the global growth slowdown leading to falling export market demand. In addition, the prospects for inflows of remittances to low-income countries have been downgraded as economic activity in migrant host countries has declined. The second is the financial deleveraging by major banks and other financial institutions in developed economies, which has markedly reduced the availability, and increased the cost, of external finance across public, corporate, and financial sectors. The third is the recent commodity price changes, which have involved a reversal of much of the commodity price boom of 2007 and 2008. The main objective of the study is to understand the impact of these macroeconomic shocks on household well-being. In particular, it seeks to understand the key macroeconomic shocks confronted by the region and the impact of such shocks on household welfare, including the effect on household income flows, consumption levels, and liabilities. It will also assess possible strategies to cope with the crisis and manage the adverse social impact.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2396", "subjectTags": ["access to credit", "accounting",

two decades have witnessed a growing recognition of the importance of taking cultural and ethnic diversity into consideration when designing and implementing development programs. As societies around the world have become more culturally diverse, and the role culture plays in the formation of identity has become better understood, governments are beginning to pay greater attention to the management of cultural diversity and are becoming more sensitive to issues of cultural exclusion. This book explores how taking cultural diversity into account can affect the delivery of services both positively and negatively, and how local governments can respond to the challenge of programming for and around diversity. The following chapter presents the current debate on the role of governments, at all levels, in managing cultural diversity. Chapter three takes a more in-depth look at specific areas in which the demand for recognition of cultural practices in the delivery of services is strongest. Chapter four examines policies pertaining to basic service delivery that can address and support cultural diversity. Finally, chapter five summarizes the lessons learned from the design of culturally sensitive policies for delivering services to a diverse population.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2403",

It also reports on the achievements of trust fund activities, financed by the Bank Netherlands Partnership Program (BNPP), that were implemented parallel to the GEF/World Bank projects. The MBC is a land-use planning system that spans Central America and Mexico. It is designed to promote the conservation and sustainable use of the region's natural resources. The overall objective of the Bank's MBC projects of consolidating the MBC was highly relevant. Although the Central American land bridge is very small, it is estimated to be home to 12 percent of the world's known species. It harbors approximately 24,000 species of vascular plants and over 500 species of mammals, many of which are endemic. The MBC derives its legitimacy from the endorsement it received at the Central American heads of state summit in 1997.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2394", "subjectTags": ["accountability",

Chain Concepts and Applications", "abstract": "The development and business communities involved in the African agriculture and agribusiness sectors have recently experienced a strong resurgence of interest in promoting value chains as an approach that can help design interventions geared to add value, lower transaction costs, diversify rural economies, and contribute to increasing rural household incomes in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) countries. Enhancing value chain competitiveness is increasingly recognized as an effective approach to generating growth and reducing the rural poverty prevalent in the region. This is a welcome development for practitioners who have long been convinced of the need to look differently at agriculture not just as a means of survival, but as smaller or larger commercial businesses linked to domestic and global markets and of the need to identify and tap into new sources of potential growth and value addition in the sector. Hopefully, renewed engagement will lead to a substantial increase in the flow of financial resources and technical assistance devoted to supporting market-driven, competitive agro-enterprises and agricultural value chains throughout the African continent. However, there is danger that this renewed engagement may not last, or may even backfire, if the high expectations placed on promoting value chains are not met. Because the development literature is not clear about the concepts and methods relating to value chains, there is risk that sooner or later the benefits of the value chain approach will be overshadowed by unmet expectations. That in turn could cause the approach to be discarded categorically. Although there is no single way to mitigate such risks, this guide aims to offer practical advice and tools to businessmen, policy makers, representatives of farmer or trade organizations, and others who are engaged in SSA agro-enterprise and agribusiness development. This guide is particularly designed for those who want to know more about value chain based approaches, and how to use them in ways that can contribute to sound operational decisions and results for enterprise and industry development, as well as for policy making with respect to doing business, stimulating investment, and enhancing trade in the context of African agriculture.", "uri":

Countries", "abstract": "The data and analysis presented in this edition of global development finance are based on actual flows and debt related transactions for 2010 reported to the World Bank Debtor Reporting System (DRS) by 129 developing countries. The reports confirm that in 2010 international capital flows to developing countries surpassed preliminary estimates and returned to their pre-crisis level of $1.1 trillion, an increase of 68 percent over the comparable figure for 2009. Private capital flows surged in 2010 driven by a massive jump in short-term debt, a strong rebound in bonds and more moderate rise in equity flows. Debt related inflows jumped almost 200 percent compared to a 25 percent increase in net equity flows. The rebound in capital flows was concentrated in a small group of 10 middle income countries where net capital inflows rose by an average of nearly 80 percent in 2010, almost double the rate of increase (44 percent) recorded by other developing countries. These 10 countries accounted for 73 percent of developing countries gross national income (GNI), and received 73 percent of total net capital flows to developing countries in 2010. The 2010 increase in net capital flows was accompanied by marked change in composition between equity and debt related flows. Over the past decade net equity flows to developing countries have consistently surpassed the level of debt related flows, reaching as high as 97 percent of aggregate net capital flows in 2002 and accounting for 75 percent of them ($509 billion) in 2009. However, periods of rapid increase in capital flows have often been marked by a reversal from equity to debt.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2392", "subjectTags": ["access to market",

Many of the region's countries are facing warmer temperatures, a changing hydrology, and more extremes, droughts, floods, heat waves, windstorms, and forest fires. This book presents an overview of what adaptation to climate change might mean for Eastern Europe and Central Asia. It starts with a discussion of emerging best-practice adaptation planning around the world and a review of the latest climate projections. It then discusses possible actions to improve resilience organized around impacts on health, natural resources (water, biodiversity, and the coastal environment), the 'unbuilt' environment (agriculture and forestry), and the built environment (infrastructure and housing). The last chapter concludes with a discussion of two areas in great need of strengthening given the changing climate: disaster preparedness and hydro-meteorological services. This book has four key messages: a) contrary to popular perception, Eastern Europe and Central Asia face significant threats from climate change, with a number of the most serious risks already in evidence; b) vulnerability over the next 10 to 20 years is likely to be dominated by socioeconomic factors and legacy issues; c) even countries and sectors that stand to benefit from climate change are poorly positioned to do so; and d) the next decade offers a window of opportunity for ECA countries to make their development more resilient to climate change while reaping numerous co-benefits.",

This primer emphasizes six pillars of labor market institutions: global trends, job creation, labor market policies, education, entrepreneurship, and globalization. Chapter one addresses current labor market trends and job creation, particularly in tough conditions. Chapter two examines channels of job creation and ways to strengthen labor market institutions to ensure sustainable job growth, considering factors such as investment climate, job policy, industrial policy, social protection, and other labor market issues. Chapter three focuses on labor market policies in developing countries. Chapter four highlights the impact of education and skills on labor market outcome. Chapter five discusses entrepreneurship along three key dimensions: development and growth, job creation, and female entrepreneurship.

This change has been motivated principally by governments seeking to lessen the fiscal impact of aging populations and to diversify the sources of retirement income. One of the key results is that many pension systems are now in the process of becoming asset backed. This increasingly links retirement incomes to the performance of these assets, resulting in participants being exposed to the uncertainties of investment markets to determine the level of benefits that they will ultimately receive. The potential consequences of this have never been more evident than during the recent global financial crisis. This introductory chapter provides an overview of the issues and motivation for this work and summarizes the studies that were conducted and their main findings. It concludes with policy-related observations that arise from the overall consideration of the research program. The remainder of the volume contains a selection of the studies undertaken through the partnership that focus on developing approaches to evaluate performance of pension funds and concludes with observations and commentary from four noted experts in the field on the issues raised by this work and the interpretation of the findings.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2405", "subjectTags": ["pension"], "pubtype": ["Directions in Development ; finance"], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2405/527090PUB0pens101Official0Use0only1.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2405/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2405", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:32:49Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2408": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2408/528610PUB0gend101Official0Use0Only1.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2408/528610PUB0gend101Official0Use0Only1.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Gender Dimensions of Investment Climate Reform : A Guide for Policy Makers and Practitioners", "abstract": "Promoting women's economic empowerment is increasingly seen as an important driving force behind economic growth and the fight against poverty.

Recognizing the socioeconomic dimensions of gender-focused work, the core module outlines the broader, overarching framework within which gender-informed investment climate work can take place. It also focuses on the monitoring and evaluation framework, with particular emphasis on establishing appropriate baselines to facilitate the measurement of gender-informed changes in the business environment. The eight thematic modules provide specific guidance on key investment climate issues comprising: (i) public-private dialogue, (ii) business start-up and operation, (iii) business taxation, (iv) trade logistics, (v) secured lending, (vi) alternative dispute resolution, (vii) special economic zones, and (viii) foreign investment policy and promotion.

As the handbook demonstrates, post-disaster reconstruction begins with a series of decisions that must be made almost immediately. Despite the urgency with which these decisions are made, they have long-term impacts, changing the lives of those affected by the disaster for years to come. As a policy maker, you may be responsible for establishing the policy framework for the entire reconstruction process or for setting reconstruction policy in only one sector. The handbook is emphatic about the importance of establishing a policy to guide reconstruction. Effective reconstruction is set in motion only after the policy maker has evaluated his or her alternatives, conferred with stakeholders, and established the framework and the rules for reconstruction. As international experience and the examples in the handbook clearly demonstrate, reconstruction policy improves both the efficiency and the effectiveness of the reconstruction process. In addition to providing advice on the content of such a policy, the handbook describes mechanisms for managing communications with stakeholders about the policy, for improving the consistency of the policy, and for monitoring the policy's implementation and outcomes.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2409", "subjectTags": ["accountability", "accounting", "accounting standards", "adb", "affordable housing", "architect", "architecture", "auditing", "audits", "building codes", "centre for research on the epidemiology", "cities", "civil service", "climate change", "communities", "community participation", "cred", "damage assessment", "damage assessments", "description", "development organization", "disaster", "disaster assistance", "disaster communications", "disaster event", "disaster management", "disaster planning", "disaster preparedness", "disaster reconstruction", "disaster recovery", "disaster reduction", "disaster risk", "disaster risk reduction", "disaster situation", "disaster situations", "disaster types", "displaced person", "earthquake", "earthquake reconstruction", "earthquakes", "economic development", "emergencies", "emergency management", "emergency operation", "emergency operations", "emergency recovery", "emergency recovery loan", "emergency relief", "emergency response", "emergency shelter", "engineer", "engineers", "erl", "explosion", "female", "financial management", "habitat", "homes", "households", "houses", "housing", "housing design", "housing policy", "human rights", "human settlements", "humanitarian assistance", "hurricane", "hurricanes", "impact of disasters", "informal settlements", "information system", "information systems", "international strategy for disaster reduction", "interventions", "land development", "land use", "laws", "local government", "local governments", "management accounting", "municipalities", "national emergency", "natural disasters", "neighborhood", "nongovernmental organization", "nongovernmental organizations", "physical planning", "public buildings", "reconstruction", "resettlement", "risk assessment", "risk management", "safety", "site development", "slum", "subsidiary", "technical assistance", "tenancy", "tornados", "towns", "transitional settlement", "transitional shelter", "transport", "tsunami", "tsunamis", "united states agency for international development", "urban development", "urban land", "urbanization", "victims", "volcanoes", "world health organization"], "pubtype": [], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2409/528390PUB0safe101Official0Use0Only1.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2409/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2409", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:32:54Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2398": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2398/524580PUB0low0101Official0Use0Only1.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2398/524580PUB0low0101Official0Use0Only1.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Low-Carbon Development for Mexico", "abstract": "One of the most compelling reasons for pursuing low-carbon development is that the potential impacts of climate change are predicted to be severe, for both industrial and developing countries, and that reducing greenhouse gas emissions can reduce the risk of the most catastrophic impacts. The challenge of reducing emissions is sobering: leading scientific models indicate that limiting the rise in global mean temperatures to less than two degree Celsius will require that global greenhouse gas emissions peak within the next 10-15 years and then fall by 2050 to levels about 50 percent lower than in 1990. Although many countries recognize the need to curtail carbon emissions, there is considerable uncertainty about how much this will cost in individual countries, what measures can be undertaken in both the short and longer term, and how cost-effective specific interventions are in reducing emissions. This study analyzes a range of energy efficiency options available in Mexico, including supply-side efficiency improvements in the electric power and oil and gas industries, and demand-side electricity efficiency measures addressing high-growth energy-consuming activities, such as air conditioning and refrigeration. It also evaluates a range of renewable energy options that make use of the country's vast wind, solar, biomass, hydro, and geothermal resources.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2398",

It follows a study on transport costs and prices along the main international trade corridors (Teravaninthorn and Raballand 2008). One of the principal findings of the research on international corridors in Africa was that trucking market structure and regulation differ widely among sub-regions in Sub-Saharan Africa; therefore, transport prices (but not necessarily transport costs)1 differ greatly among sub-regions and corridors. The trucking environment and market structure in West and Central Africa are characterized by cartels offering low transport quality, whereas in East Africa, the trucking environment is more competitive and the market is more mature. Much of the transport price burden along African corridors seems to depend on the political economy of freight logistics.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2425", "subjectTags": ["access roads", "access to markets", "accessibility", "affordable transport", "agricultural growth", "agricultural output", "agricultural production", "agricultural productivity", "agricultural products", "agricultural value", "aid effectiveness", "animal-drawn carts", "better road", "bicycle", "bicycle path", "bicycles", "bikes", "bitumen", "bridge", "bridges", "buffer zone", "car", "cargo", "cars", "cash crops", "catchment", "catchment area", "commercial farmers", "cost-benefit analysis", "costs of transport", "crop production", "crop yields", "culverts", "disabilities", "district roads", "ditches", "drainage", "economies of scale", "elderly people", "externalities", "farm size", "farmers", "feeder road", "feeder roads", "financial burden", "fleet efficiency", "food consumption", "food crops", "food price", "footbridges", "framework", "freight", "fuel", "fuel consumption", "gps", "gravel", "gravel road", "gravel roads", "high population density", "highway", "highways", "household consumption", "household income", "household size", "household survey", "household surveys", "impact of transport", "imt", "income", "income gap", "income growth", "infrastructure investment", "intermediate means of transport", "international road federation", "investment in roads", "journey", "lack of infrastructure", "landslides", "local authorities", "main road", "main roads", "means of transport", "mode of transport", "mode of transportation", "modes of transport", "motorcycle", "motorcycles", "motorized transport", "national roads", "national transport", "overlay", "passenger", "paths", "pavement", "pedestrians", "per capita consumption", "periodic maintenance", "piarc", "political economy", "poor", "poor people", "poor road", "poor road infrastructure", "population density", "ports", "potholes", "poverty analysis", "poverty line", "poverty rates", "poverty reduction", "profit margin", "public roads", "public spending", "public transportation", "public works", "rain", "reconstruction", "regional roads", "remote communities", "repaving", "resurfacing", "road", "road access", "road accessibility", "road accidents", "road alignment", "road characteristics", "road conditions", "road deterioration", "road development", "road improvements", "road infrastructure", "road investment", "road investments", "road maintenance", "road network", "road networks", "road planning", "road projects", "road quality", "road roughness", "road sector", "road system", "road transport", "road transport services", "road type", "road types", "road-user", "roughness predictions", "routine maintenance", "rural", "rural access", "rural access roads", "rural area", "rural areas", "rural communities", "rural consumers", "rural development", "rural growth", "rural households", "rural mobility", "rural people", "rural population", "rural populations", "rural poverty", "rural prices", "rural road", "rural road density", "rural road infrastructure", "rural road investment", "rural road investments", "rural road projects", "rural road rehabilitation", "rural roads", "rural transport", "rural transport infrastructure", "safety", "secondary roads", "small farms", "span", "taxis", "terrain", "tertiary road network", "tracks", "traffic", "traffic generation", "traffic growth", "traffic levels", "trail", "transaction costs", "transport", "transport access", "transport accessibility", "transport burden", "transport cost", "transport cost savings", "transport costs", "transport demand", "transport infrastructure", "transport investment", "transport modes", "transport operators", "transport price", "transport projects", "transport quality", "transport requirements", "transport service", "transport service providers", "transport tariffs", "transport time", "transportation costs", "transportation facility", "travel time", "trip", "truck transport", "trucking", "trucks", "true", "tunnels", "type of transport", "types of roads", "unpaved roads", "urban transport", "user costs", "value of time", "vehicle", "vehicle maintenance", "vehicle operating", "vehicle operating cost", "vehicle operating costs", "vehicle operation", "vehicle speed", "vehicle traffic", "vehicle types", "vehicles", "verge", "walking", "walking distance", "walking time"], "pubtype": ["Directions in Development ;

Traditional approaches to delivering public support have not always led to the results intended. Results-based financing instruments are now recognized as one important piece of the aid-delivery puzzle. Results-based financing (RBF) is an umbrella term that includes output-based aid, provider payment incentives, performance-based interfiscal transfers, and conditional cash transfers. What these mechanisms have in common is that a principal entity provides a financial or in-kind reward, conditional on the recipient of that reward undertaking a set of predetermined actions or achieving a predetermined performance goal. The ultimate aim is to increase the effectiveness of scarce public resources for the provision of basic services. This book is structured as follows:  part one includes chapter one, which defines output-based aid (OBA) and puts it in the context of traditional aid-delivery mechanisms and RBF instruments. Chapter two provides an overview of where OBA approaches are being implemented as well as a description of the various applications of OBA: one-off, transitional, or ongoing subsidies. Part two consists of six chapters comprising the specific sector reviews: information and communication technology (ICT), roads (transportation), energy, water and sanitation, health, and education. Part three starts with chapter nine, which summarizes the lessons learned from the specific sectors, focusing on cross-cutting issues. Chapter ten concludes the review and considers where OBA is heading and what can be done to make OBA more effective and widespread, where applicable, to help improve access to basic services for the poor. The appendix presents a table of all OBA projects identified in the World Bank Group to date.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2423", "subjectTags": ["accountability", "accounting", "adb", "air", "air pollution", "auction", "auctions", "best practice", "best practices", "bilateral aid", "bonds", "boundaries", "capital subsidies", "capitals", "cell phone", "cellular network", "cellular networks", "certificates", "communication technology", "communications infrastructure", "computers", "constraint", "copyright", "counterparts", "culverts", "customer segments", "dedicated data", "development aid", "development project", "development projects", "distribution network", "e-mail", "economic assistance", "economic development", "economies of scale", "electricity", "enabling environment", "finance ministries", "financial burdens", "financial instruments", "fuel", "fuel taxes", "fund management", "funds for road construction", "government funding", "hardware", "health services", "heavy vehicle", "highway", "highway maintenance", "household access", "ibrd", "ict", "ifc", "infrastructure development", "innovation", "innovations", "inspection", "inspections", "installation", "institution", "institutional capacity", "insurance", "international bank", "international cooperation", "international development", "international donors", "international telecommunication", "international transit", "legal framework", "length of roads", "levies", "license", "license fees", "licenses", "local roads", "maintenance costs", "management system", "material", "meeting", "microfinance", "mobile phone", "mobile phone subscribers", "monies", "municipal finance", "municipal services", "national highways", "national transport", "nations", "network services", "nongovernmental organization", "nongovernmental organizations", "operational efficiency", "outsourcing", "penalties", "performance indicators", "phone connection", "phone connections", "phone lines", "phones", "photo", "physical connections", "ports", "present value", "private investment", "private partnership", "private roads", "private sector", "private sector development", "private sector participation", "privatization", "procurement", "productivity", "project design", "public", "public expenditure", "public expenditure review", "public finance", "public funds", "public goods", "public partnerships", "public resources", "public sector", "public sector investments", "public spending", "public utilities", "public utility", "queries", "radio", "radio frequencies", "radio spectrum", "railways", "reconstruction", "reform programs", "rehabilitation", "result", "results", "road", "road accidents", "road conditions", "road expenditures", "road maintenance", "road network", "road projects", "road sector", "road shoulder", "road standards", "road transport", "road use", "road users", "roads", "rural roads", "sanitation", "savings", "service contract", "service provider", "service providers", "social service", "social services", "subsidiary", "supervision", "targets", "tax", "tax revenue", "tax revenues", "technical assistance", "technical cooperation", "telecommunications", "telecommunications company", "telephone", "telephony", "toll", "toll road", "tolls", "traffic", "traffic levels", "transparency", "transport projects", "transport sector", "transportation", "universal access", "universal service", "usability", "user", "user community", "uses", "vehicle", "verification", "water supply", "web", "web site"], "pubtype": ["Directions in Development ; finance"], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2423/536440PUB0outp101Official0Use0Only1.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2423/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2423", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:33:13Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2257": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2257/589980PUB0ID181UBLIC109780821385722.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2257/589980PUB0ID181UBLIC109780821385722.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Peru : Country Program Evaluation for the World Bank Group, 2003-09", "abstract": "Since 2003, Peru has emerged as an open, rapidly growing economy. Over the review period of 2003-09, successive governments adopted policy platforms aimed at maintaining macroeconomic stability, furthering the private sector supply response, broadening participation in growth, improving social service delivery, and strengthening public institutions. The World Bank Group (WBG) supported each of the three pillars of the government's poverty reduction strategy, namely: (i) broad-based economic growth that engaged a higher share of the population; (ii) enhanced human development through improved social service delivery; and (iii) strengthened public sector institutions. Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) recommends that the WBG: (i) tailor its strategy to support long-term integration of Peru's three distinct regions; (ii) seek opportunities to support large-scale infrastructure development; (iii) develop a more strategic approach to helping improve public sector management; (iv) seek further innovations in International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD's) instruments against a backdrop of declining demand for its financial resources; (v) seek to help develop a strategic planning function in Peru; (vi) build a close strategic partnership with development partners that provides concessional finance in the social sectors to optimize synergies with IBRD policy lending and analytic and advisory activities; (vii) develop a strategic focus for International Finance Corporation (IFC) around employment- generating industries in emerging sectors; (viii) maintain IFC's additionality by supporting lower-tier and more regionally dispersed private companies; and (ix) leverage the strong country presence of IBRD and IFC to enhance Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency's (MIGA's) marketing and risk assessment functions.", "uri":

how macroeconomic policies create differential opportunities for women and men. This volume comprises nine chapters covering four broad themes: gender as a category of analysis in macroeconomics; the implications of gender for macroeconomic aggregates, in particular consumption and economic growth; the role of gender in the labor market, globalization, and access to credit; and gender budgeting. Chapters one and two address the first theme. Chapter one focuses on the macroeconomic cost to growth and development that arises from rigid gender roles and associated gender asymmetries. Chapter two documents the progress made in gender mainstreaming by highlighting developments in data collection and monitoring that have moved beyond simply disaggregating data by male and female. Chapters three and four cover the second theme. Chapter three considers the role of gender relations in the macroeconomic aggregates of consumption, savings, investment, and government expenditure and the implications for macroeconomic policy in these areas. Chapter four examines gender relations and economic growth. Chapters five through seven focus on the third theme. Chapter five examines the labor market. Chapter six examines how globalization affects gender relations, particularly employment. Chapter seven concentrates on women's access to finance and documents gender asymmetries in this market. Chapter eight, on the fourth theme, highlights the impact fiscal policies have on gender relations. It documents how policy can be made more gender specific and reports on the progress made by countries that have adopted gender-responsive government budgeting. Chapter nine summarizes what is known about gender and macroeconomic policy, noting areas in which the literature is well developed as well as areas that require further research and study.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2256", "subjectTags": ["access to credit", "access to finance", "access to resources", "agricultural products", "allocation of resources", "bank loans", "biases", "biological differences", "births", "borrowing", "capital accounts", "child mortality", "child mortality rates", "civil society organizations", "credit association", "credit markets", "debt", "developing countries", "development policies", "disparities between girls", "disposable income", "dissemination", "domestic violence", "earnings", "economic activities", "economic contribution", "economic crises", "economic development", "economic empowerment", "economic growth", "economic opportunities", "economic policies", "economic policy", "economic resources", "economic role of women", "education level", "educational attainment", "educational opportunities", "effects of gender", "employer", "employers", "employment opportunity", "employment status", "empowerment of women", "enrollment", "entrepreneurs", "equal opportunities", "equal pay", "equality of opportunity", "expenditure", "expenditures", "families", "family income", "family welfare", "female genital mutilation", "female labor", "female labor force", "female labor force participation", "female literacy", "female population", "feminism", "feminist", "feminist economics", "feminists", "finance access", "financial market", "financial services", "fiscal policies", "formal education", "gender", "gender advisers", "gender analysis", "gender asymmetries", "gender awareness", "gender biases", "gender blind", "gender budgeting", "gender differences", "gender dimensions", "gender discrimination", "gender disparities", "gender disparity", "gender division of labor", "gender equality", "gender equality goals", "gender equality in rights", "gender equity", "gender gap", "gender gaps", "gender indicators", "gender inequalities", "gender inequality", "gender issues", "gender mainstreaming", "gender neutral", "gender norms", "gender parity", "gender relations", "gender roles", "gender sensitive", "gender specific", "gender statistics", "gender-related issues", "girls", "gross domestic product", "gross enrollment ratio", "gross national product", "household chores", "household dynamics", "household income", "household level", "households", "human capital", "human development", "human resources", "husbands", "ids", "illiteracy", "illness", "immunization", "implications for development", "income-generating activities", "individual choices", "informal sector", "information service", "integration of gender", "international bank", "international migrants", "labor force", "labor force participation", "labor market", "labor markets", "labour market", "labour organization", "lack of access", "land ownership", "legal abortions", "legal status", "levels of education", "life expectancy", "literacy rates", "live births", "low-income countries", "mainstreaming gender", "market economy", "married women", "maternal health", "microcredit", "millennium development goal", "mother", "nutrition", "older women", "opportunities for women", "parliamentary seats", "participation by women", "participation in decision", "persistent inequalities", "point of departure", "policy implications", "polygamy", "primary school", "primary school??age", "productivity", "progress", "public policy", "purchasing power", "purchasing power parity", "rape", "reproductive roles", "respect", "role of gender", "rural areas", "savings", "savings rate", "school attendance", "school year", "school-age population", "secondary education", "self-employment", "sex", "sex differences", "sex discrimination", "sex discrimination against women", "sex ratio", "sexes", "sexual division of labor", "sexuality", "small businesses", "small enterprise", "small enterprises", "social sciences", "sources of income", "status of women", "tertiary education", "undp", "unemployment", "unemployment rates", "unesco", "unifem", "united nations", "united nations development fund for women", "united nations development programme", "urban areas", "violence against women", "wage differentials", "wid", "woman", "women farmers", "women in development", "women in education", "work experience", "world health organization", "young children", "young women"], "pubtype": ["Directions in Development ;

This report shows how smart investments and policies in transport can connect poor places to the dynamic economies of their rich neighbors. There is also a wide open field of opportunity for telecommunications to bring electronic proximity to lagging areas. Many countries have spent huge sums on subsidies to entice investors to lagging areas-usually without any sustainable impact. This report recommends that governments turn their efforts toward the new approach to local economic development, which is gaining ground around the world, and is based on economic clusters, local competitive advantage, private initiative, and public-private dialogue. The report describes the state-of-play in territorial planning, public financial management, targeted programs, deconcentration, and decentralization, and it sketches some emerging lessons. This report combines the insights of specialists in the majority of the World Bank's key sectors: agriculture, development economics, education, health, poverty analysis, social protection, and transport. It is the report's modest aim, if not to offer a single formula for reducing spatial disparities, at least to propose a range of policy options that the region's leaders can reflect on in the light of their national objectives.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2255", "subjectTags": ["accounting", "accounting practices", "accounting standards", "advanced technology", "atm", "atm card", "bank branches", "basic", "business development", "central banks", "commercial banks", "commercialization", "communication technologies", "communication technology", "communities", "computerization", "credit cards", "credit products", "database management", "deficits", "deposit market", "depositors", "deposits", "digital", "digital divide", "e-government", "e-learning", "e-mail", "egovernment", "financial institution", "financial institutions", "financial performance", "financial service providers", "financial services", "financial transactions", "fixed asset", "income", "information services", "insurance", "international mail", "international remittance", "international remittances", "latin american", "learning", "legal framework", "letter carriers", "liquidity", "mail business", "mail carrier", "mail carriers", "mail flow", "mail flows", "mail handling", "mail items", "mail processing", "mail service", "mail services", "mail volume", "mail volumes", "management information systems", "marketing", "microfinance", "middle east", "migration", "money transfer", "money transfer products", "money transfer services", "money transfers", "money transmission", "national postal", "national postal operator", "national postal operators", "new technologies", "new technology", "north africa", "number of post offices", "outsourcing", "packages", "parcels", "payment services", "payment systems", "payments instruments", "pensions", "post", "post office", "post office savings", "post office savings banks", "post offices", "postal", "postal administrations", "postal agents", "postal bank", "postal banks", "postal checking", "postal counters", "postal employee", "postal financial services", "postal infrastructure", "postal mail", "postal management", "postal market", "postal markets", "postal network", "postal networks", "postal offices", "postal operations", "postal operator", "postal operators", "postal organizations", "postal policy", "postal reform", "postal revenues", "postal savings", "postal sector reform", "postal service", "postal services", "postal staff", "posts", "private operators", "privatization", "productivity", "profitability", "programs", "public agencies", "public postal sector", "public services", "quality of service", "remittance services", "remittances for development", "remittances ?? product", "remote post offices", "rural post offices", "savings accounts", "savings banks", "savings mobilization", "subsidiaries", "telecommunication", "telecommunication services", "telecommunications", "traditional mail", "transport", "universal postal", "universal postal union", "universal service", "universal service obligation", "upu", "volume of mail", "volumes of mail", "worldwide postal network"], "pubtype": ["MENA Development Report"], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2255/589970PUB0ID181UBLIC109780821383216.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2255/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2255", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:02:28Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2253": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2253/588480PUB0Conf101public10BOX353816B.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2253/588480PUB0Conf101public10BOX353816B.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Confronting Poverty in Iraq : Main Findings", "abstract": "This book provides the most comprehensive and rigorous analysis of Iraqi living standards to be carried out in several decades. It makes extensive use of the Iraq Household Socio-Economic Survey (IHSES), the first nationwide income and expenditure survey since 1988. IHSES data were complemented with a wide range of other sources, providing a holistic perspective on living standards that was previously unavailable. The analysis presented here was carried out with two main goals, first, to inform the Government's poverty reduction strategy; and second, to create a baseline against which future progress in poverty reduction can be monitored and assessed. Iraq is moving forward. The challenge requires re-development and recovery of what has been lost, including the stimulus provided by economic opportunity. A transition in policy is needed from provision of minimal food subsistence to long-term investments in human productivity. An environment more conducive to the poor can be created by investments that help citizens to benefit from their own labor and education. This challenge is being concretely addressed in the newly adopted national Poverty Reduction Strategy. That strategy, informed by the present analysis, articulates clear priorities for government spending and detailed programmatic actions.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2253", "subjectTags": ["inequality"], "pubtype": [], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2253/588480PUB0Conf101public10BOX353816B.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2253/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2253", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:02:25Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2252": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2252/588470PUB0Weal101public10BOX353816B.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2252/588470PUB0Weal101public10BOX353816B.txt?sequence=2", "title": "The Changing Wealth of Nations : Measuring Sustainable Development in the New Millennium", "abstract": "This book is about development and measuring development progress. While precise definitions may vary, development is, at heart, a process of building wealth, the produced, natural, human, and institutional capital which is the source of income and wellbeing. A key finding is that it is intangible wealth, human and institutional capital, which dominates the wealth of all countries, rising as a share of the total as countries climb the development ladder. The book is divided into two parts. The first part provides the big picture of changes in wealth by income group and geographic region, with a focus on natural capital because it is especially important for low-income developing countries. The second part presents case studies that illustrate particular aspects of wealth accounting, including accounting for climate change, the role of intangible capital in growth and development, measuring human capital, and the use of wealth accounting to improve transparency and governance in resource-rich economies. The final chapter reports on the implementation of wealth accounting by countries. The appendixes provide the full wealth accounts for individual countries and for aggregations by income group and geographic region.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2252", "subjectTags": ["accountability", "accounting system", "agricultural land", "agricultural production", "agriculture", "air pollution", "annual basis", "asset liquidation", "asset value", "asset values", "assets", "capital gains", "carbon", "carbon dioxide", "climate change", "commercial fishing", "complementary investments", "consumption expenditure", "damages", "deforestation", "developed countries", "development economics", "development strategies", "discounted value", "distribution of wealth", "drinking water", "economic change", "economic consequences", "economic development", "economic growth", "economic justification", "economic progress", "economic research", "economic sustainability", "economic value", "economists", "elasticities", "emissions", "environmental", "environmental accounting", "environmental damages", "environmental degradation", "environmental economics", "exchange rates", "externalities", "fay", "fish", "fisheries", "fishing", "fixed capital", "gdp", "greenhouse gases", "gross domestic product", "gross national savings", "growth rate", "human capital", "human well-being", "income", "income groups", "intergenerational equity", "international law", "international trade", "inventory", "land use", "land value", "laws", "livestock products", "macroeconomic management", "macroeconomic performance", "market price", "market prices", "metals", "migration", "ministries of finance", "monetary fund", "national accounting", "national income", "natural capital", "natural resources", "net foreign assets", "net losses", "npv", "oil", "opportunity cost", "ozone layer", "policy instruments", "policy makers", "political economy", "population growth", "portfolio", "present value", "price changes", "producers", "productive assets", "productive use", "property rights", "proven reserves", "public expenditures", "public goods", "purchasing power", "rates of return", "real prices", "rents", "resource management", "savings", "savings rates", "social costs", "social welfare", "subsidiary", "sustainable development", "taxation", "technological change", "timber", "timber prices", "total factor productivity", "total factor productivity growth", "transition economies", "transparency", "urbanization", "valuation", "wealth", "wealth creation", "wetlands", "willingness to pay", "wtp"], "pubtype": ["Environment and Development"], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2252/588470PUB0Weal101public10BOX353816B.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2252/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2252", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:02:23Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2318": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2318/627060PUB0Unle000public00BOX361489B.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2318/627060PUB0Unle000public00BOX361489B.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Unleashing the Potential of Renewable Energy in India", "abstract": "India has 150 GW of renewable energy potential, about half in the form of small hydropower, biomass, and wind and half in solar, cogeneration, and waste-to-energy.

This diagnostic note draws on a detailed analysis conducted by a PricewaterhouseCoopers India consulting team in 2008-09 for the World Bank. The data are based on information on about 180 wind, biomass, and small hydropower projects in 20 states, as well as information from and norms of the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) and the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC). The study is intended to provoke discussions of the feasibility of renewable energy development in India. Why is renewable energy development relevant? How much development is economically feasible? What needs to be done to realize the potential? Each of these topics is addressed in a separate chapter, all of which suggest a few implementable measures that India can consider to tap its economically feasible unharnessed potential.", "uri":

Both reports draw primarily on information from data collected prior to the crisis. This report also uses data on employment and access to finance collected during the crisis in a subset of ECA countries. The global financial crisis has had enormous consequences for firms' access to finance, the availability of qualified workers, and the ability of governments to provide (and of private sector to obtain) reliable infrastructure services. The extent and impact of these constraints is yet to be determined but their presence at a time of economic growth suggests they may re-emerge during the post-crisis economic recovery. The BEEPS captures information on a number of aspects of the business environment. This report highlights the elements of firm finance, labor regulations and skills, and infrastructure that are covered by the BEEPS questionnaire.

"Revenue administration is a major interface between the state and its citizens. A good revenue administration is, therefore, an important attribute of good government. As a result, in recent years, policy makers have become increasingly aware of the importance of policies that will promote business development while ensuring voluntary tax compliance. In the modern context, it is neither desirable nor feasible to examine or inspect every single taxpayer. The revenue administration, therefore, has to rely on effective management of compliance. Promoting voluntary compliance, achieved through a self-assessment system in which taxpayers comply with their tax obligations without intervention from tax officials, requires developing modern approaches to audits based on risk management. The impact of audits critically depends on a properly designed audit selection strategy focused on high-risk taxpayers to provide the most cost-effective outcome. This, in itself, contributes to promoting voluntary compliance. Risk-based country audits: approaches and country experiences are an important study of this critical revenue function of compliance management.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2314", "subjectTags": ["accounting", "accounting treatment", "administrative costs", "advance pricing", "alm", "asymmetric information", "auditors", "bank credit", "banks", "barrier", "business development", "business tax", "capital investment", "cash flows", "checks", "commodity", "conflicts of interest", "copyright clearance", "copyright clearance center", "corporate governance", "corporate income tax", "corporate tax", "corporate tax planning", "cost structure", "credit card", "credit risk", "credit scoring", "cross-border transactions", "customer information", "data flows", "debt", "debt collection", "deductions", "demographic", "developing countries", "econometrics", "employment", "exchange transactions", "excise tax", "expenditures", "exposure", "externalities", "finance corporation", "financial data", "financial structures", "financing arrangements", "fiscal reform", "foreign exchange", "foreign exchange transactions", "fraud", "global risk", "globalization", "good governance", "governance practices", "government policies", "government revenues", "gross profit", "gross revenue", "growth rates", "holding", "income", "income tax", "income taxes", "inflation", "information processing", "information sharing", "information system", "information technologies", "information technology", "input tax", "insurance", "insurance companies", "insurance company", "interest rates", "internal revenue", "international bank", "international development", "international economics", "international economy", "international finance", "international tax law", "inventory", "investment climate", "judgment", "legal framework", "legal obligations", "legislation", "level of risk", "market segmentation", "micro enterprises", "monetary fund", "operating costs", "opportunity cost", "opportunity costs", "output", "particular country", "peer review", "penalties", "profit margin", "property rights", "public funds", "public services", "real estate", "regulatory authorities", "risk management", "risk management system", "risk management systems", "risk profiles", "risk reduction", "sales tax", "shareholder", "shareholder protection", "shareholders", "small business", "small businesses", "small enterprises", "subsidiary", "tax", "tax administration", "tax assessment", "tax audit", "tax auditing", "tax audits", "tax avoidance", "tax base", "tax collections", "tax compliance", "tax consultants", "tax credit", "tax evasion", "tax law", "tax liabilities", "tax liability", "tax obligations", "tax payers", "tax policies", "tax policy", "tax rate", "tax receipts", "tax reform", "tax reforms", "tax regime", "tax return", "tax returns", "tax revenue", "tax rules", "tax savings", "tax structure", "tax system", "tax systems", "tax treatment", "taxation", "taxation power", "taxpayer", "taxpayer service", "taxpayer services", "taxpayers", "technical assistance", "trading", "transaction", "transfer pricing", "transition countries", "transition economies", "treasury", "turnover", "value added tax", "value added taxes", "warehouse", "warehouses"], "pubtype": [], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2314/627010PUB0Risk000public00BOX361489B.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2314/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2314", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:03:55Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2315": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2315/626990PUB0WDI0000public00BOX361489B.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2315/626990PUB0WDI0000public00BOX361489B.txt?sequence=2", "title": "World Development Indicators 2011", "abstract": "World development indicators 2011, the 15th edition in its current format, aims to provide relevant, high-quality, internationally comparable statistics about development and the quality of people's lives around the globe.

Cities consume much of the world's energy, and thus produce much of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. Yet cities, to varying extents, are also vulnerable to climate change impacts, with poor populations facing the greatest risk. Thus, adaptation and increased resilience constitute priorities for every city, and cities have a key role to play in mitigating climate change. Climate change mitigation and adaptation in cities has emerged as a new theme on the global agenda, creating a strong desire among governments, the private sector, and the academic community worldwide to learn from experiences and good practice examples. The 5th urban research symposium made an important contribution to the growing body of knowledge and practice in the area of cities and climate change. During the three-day symposium, approximately 200 papers were presented to more than 700 participants representing more than 70 countries. As co-organizers, the authors found it very rewarding to have such an audience and to see the wide range of topics discussed, from indicators and measurement to institutions and governance. This publication is comprised of an edited selection of the many papers submitted to the symposium and gives a flavor of the questions asked and possible answers. (The entire collection of symposium papers is available as an online resource for interested readers.)

One of the most visible outcomes of this transformation is the rise of a number of dynamic emerging-market countries to the helm of the global economy. It is likely that, by 2025, emerging economies, such as Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, and the Russian Federation, will be major contributors to global growth, alongside the advanced economies. As they pursue growth opportunities abroad and encouraged by improved policies at home, corporations based in emerging markets are playing an increasingly prominent role in global business and cross border investment. The international monetary system is likely to cease being dominated by a single currency. Emerging-market countries, where three-fourths of official foreign exchange reserves are currently held and whose sovereign wealth funds and other pools of capital are increasingly important sources of international investment, will become key players in financial markets. In short, a new world order with a more diff use distribution of economic power is emerging, thus the shift toward multipolarity. The new report serves as a vehicle for stimulating new thinking and research on anticipated structural changes in the global economic landscape. To retain this forward looking orientation and to serve the World Bank Group's mandate of development and poverty alleviation, it is envisaged that future editions of Global Development Horizon (GDH) will be dedicated to themes of importance to the emerging development agenda and global economic governance, including changing global income inequality, increasing economic insecurity, global population aging, and the future shape of development finance.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2313", "subjectTags": ["emerging growth"], "pubtype": [], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2313/GDH2011_Chinese.pdf.jpg?sequence=13", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2313/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2313", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:03:54Z"}, "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2311": {"pdfUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2311/626250PUB0Dam000id0182160BOX361487B.pdf?sequence=1", "txtUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2311/626250PUB0Dam000id0182160BOX361487B.txt?sequence=2", "title": "Opportunities in Dam Planning and Management : A Communication Practitioner's Handbook for Large Water Infrastructure", "abstract": "Communication for development is a comparatively new field that offers new tools and techniques to support inclusive and informed decisions in the planning and management of large water and energy infrastructure projects, including dams. Rethinking the approach to communication on dam projects is also timely in today's policy context. A window of opportunity has opened to tie in governance reform (including fighting corruption), poverty reduction, and communication with today's challenges in sustainable infrastructure development. Progress on any one of these aspects requires effective communication with stakeholders and interests. This handbook aims to help foster a 'communication culture' that will accommodate the wide range of stakeholder interests in dam planning and management in ways appropriate to the development context of today and the need to promote solutions to sustainability challenges. It seeks to create awareness among practitioners of the benefits and costs of improving the role of communication in infrastructure development. It also demonstrates how communication helps to improve governments' capacities to address corruption issues in infrastructure. Finally, this handbook is aimed at building the capacity of project teams and government officials to effectively adopt and adapt modern communication principles and tools to cover all stages of the dam project cycle.", "uri": "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/2311", "subjectTags": ["access to information", "accountability", "accounting", "action plan", "analytical tools", "anticorruption", "anticorruption efforts", "anticorruption measures", "anticorruption reforms", "anticorruption strategy", "assets", "audits", "bank operations", "barrier", "behaviors", "best practice", "bidding", "boundaries", "bribery", "bribery of foreign public officials", "bribes", "budget allocations", "business associations", "business practice", "capacity building", "change in thinking", "civil society", "collaboration", "collusion", "combating bribery", "commodity", "communication activities", "communication activity", "communication protocol", "communication strategies", "communication strategy", "communities", "competitive investment", "complexity", "confidence", "continuous improvement", "copyright", "copyright clearance", "copyright clearance center", "corporate culture", "corporate finance", "corporate governance", "corrupt", "corrupt practices", "decentralization", "decision making", "decision-making", "developing countries", "developing country", "discussion", "discussions", "dissemination of information", "documents", "domains", "e-mail", "economic development", "economic integration", "electricity", "end-user", "energy infrastructure", "entry points", "environmental impact", "environmental management", "environmental performance", "environmental performances", "environmental risks", "equator principles", "equipment", "ethical behavior", "ethics", "exposures", "fight against corruption", "financial institutions", "financial intermediaries", "fraud", "freedom of information", "global initiatives", "global investment", "good governance", "good practice", "governance reform", "governance reforms", "government budget", "government budgets", "government officials", "government organizations", "government policy", "grand corruption", "growth strategies", "human capacity", "human resource", "human resource management", "ideas", "image", "impact assessment", "implementation stage", "implementation stages", "implementing agencies", "implementing agency", "income", "income groups", "incomes", "information dissemination", "information policies", "information sharing", "infrastructure development", "infrastructure investment", "infrastructure investments", "infrastructure project", "infrastructure projects", "innovation", "insights", "institutional capacities", "institutional capacity", "insurance", "integration", "integrity", "interface", "internal communication", "investment climate", "ip", "judiciary", "kickbacks", "knowledge development", "knowledge gaps", "knowledge management", "knowledge sharing", "laws", "leadership", "learning", "legislation", "licenses", "low-income countries", "management system", "management systems", "management tool", "material", "media relations", "money laundering", "multimedia", "natural resource", "outputs", "penalties", "performances", "photo", "policy framework", "political economy", "political risk", "political risks", "politicians", "portfolio", "practitioners", "private investment", "private partnerships", "private sector", "private sector investments", "private sectors", "procurement", "procurement processes", "procurements", "professional discipline", "project management", "prosecution", "prosecutions", "protocol", "public finance", "public relations", "public-private partnerships", "quality of service", "quality of services", "queries", "reform programs", "regulators", "regulatory agencies", "regulatory oversight", "regulatory systems", "result", "results", "risk exposures", "risk management", "risk reduction", "sanctions", "server", "service delivery", "social responsibility", "subsidiary", "supervision", "sustainable development", "targets", "technical issues", "telephone", "thinking", "translation", "transmission", "transparency", "transparency initiative", "transparency initiatives", "trials", "user groups", "users", "uses", "water supply", "work force"], "pubtype": [], "thumbUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2311/626250PUB0Dam000id0182160BOX361487B.pdf.jpg?sequence=4", "licenseUrl": "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2311/license.txt?sequence=3", "okrID": "oai:openknowledge.worldbank.org:10986/2311", "issueDate": "2012-03-19T09:03:52Z"}}
